<h4><a id="INTRODUCTION"></a>INTRODUCTION</h4>


<p>The province of Dalecarlia has often been called the heart of Sweden.
It is a centrally located inland province, said to contain a sample
of everything the country can offer in the way of natural beauty. For
centuries it played a remarkable part in Swedish history, taking the
leadership time and again in the long struggle to rid the nation of a
perverted and abused union with Denmark and Norway. It has preserved
the original stock, the original language, and the original customs
of the race as no other province. The dialects used in Dalecarlia are
among the most difficult to understand for outsiders and have an air of
antiquity that irresistibly leads the thought back to old Norse. The
picturesque costumes characteristic of the different parishes are still
in use, and one of these&mdash;that of Rättvik&mdash;has almost become <i>the</i>
national costume of Sweden.</p>

<p>The people are simple and shrewd, stem and kindly, energetic and
obstinate, loyal and independent. They have much in common with the
old New England stock, but possess, in spite of their unmistakably
Puritanical outlook, a great store of spontaneous and pleasant joy
in life. They are thinkers in their own humble way, but not morbid.
In their attitude toward each other and toward the family they are
distinctly and quaintly patriarchal, and in this respect, too, they
preserve a quality that used to be characteristic of the whole
Scandinavian north. It is impossible to read "The Bridal Crown," with
its typical Dalecarlian atmosphere and setting, without being struck
at once by the extent to which the individual plays the part of a
link in the unbroken chain of generations rather than of an isolated,
all-important point of personality. And the same impression is obtained
from Selma Lagerlöf's contemporaneous novel, "Jerusalem."</p>

<p>Always a very religious race, though not always good church-goers, the
Dalecarlians have long had and still have the Puritanical closeness to
the Bible as <i>the</i> book, and they talk naturally in quotations from
that source. At the same time the old Norse stores of legend and homely
wisdom survive among them to an extent that is perhaps paralleled only
in Iceland. And when Strindberg in this play makes his characters quote
the old poetic Edda he violates no law of probability, although it is
doubtful whether the expression in question would actually come in
just such a form from living lips. I mean that the sentiment of such
a phrase as "Vagrant women make bread of mould for their men as only
food" survives among the people, while it is likely to have gradually
changed into a form more wholly their own.</p>

<p>No matter from where the inspiration of their utterances may come,
the Dalecarlians are apt to express themselves picturesquely,
and this inclination to lapse into rhyme and alliteration is
noticeable&mdash;sometimes in quoting old saws dating back to heathen times
and sometimes in improvising. Strindberg has used this tendency in
both ways. When the old grandfather says to the bride that she is
"comely as he is homely," he is merely repeating a phrase dear to the
heart of a people strongly bound up in traditions. When, on the other
hand, he lets the fisherman in the last scene answer, "Krummedikke's
castle and Krummedikke's lake, Krummedikke's church, and soon it will
break," he is probably illustrating the tendency toward roughly rhymed
improvisations.</p>

<p>A typical feature of Dalecarlian life has always been the sending of
the cattle to upland pastures during the summer months in care of young
men and women, who, in communication among themselves as well as with
the people at the home farm, have availed themselves of the ancient
alpenhorn, or <i>lur</i>, made out of wood and birch bark, as well as of the
horn made out of the natural horn of the ox. And instinctively they
have realised that melodious utterance carries farther than ordinary
speech, and so they have come to sing or hum their communications.
Furthermore, they have grown accustomed to use some song already
familiar to the listener rather than what they might improvise, and
have thus learned to pass on simple pieces of news, or a mere mood,
perhaps, in what might be called a code.</p>

<p>Throughout Sweden such songs and snatches and tunes, made up in olden
days by some more than usually audacious village genius, survived until
far into the past century, and in Dalecarlia and a few neighbouring
provinces they have survived to the present day in actual use. With the
flaring up of a true historical interest that followed the Romantic
movement of the early nineteenth century came a recognition of the
beauty and value of those old songs and tunes. The first man in Sweden
to make a systematic collection of them was Richard Dybeck, who,
during the years 1842-50 published a periodical for lovers of the old
which he called <i>Runa</i>&mdash;"The Rune." In 1846 the same man published a
separate collection of the folk-material just referred to under the
name of <i>Svenska Vallvisor och Hornlåtar</i>&mdash;"Swedish Herd-Songs and
Horn-Melodies."</p>

<p>Both this little volume and the issues of "The Rune" must have come
under the attention of Strindberg at an early period, and to both he
remained strongly attached throughout life. In the pages of those
two Dybeck publications he found almost everything that makes "The
Bridal Crown" what it is&mdash;a remarkable picture of the external life and
internal spirit of the Dalecarlian people. The musical duet between
<i>Kersti</i> and <i>Mats</i> in the first scene is the basis of the whole play.
It is found in Dybeck's work just as Strindberg has used it&mdash;both the
music and the words. The legend has it that a young man and a young
woman, herding cattle in adjoining pastures, fell in love with each
other. The girl bore a child, which they nursed together as they best
could, having tried to legitimise it by going through a simple wedding
ceremony of their own improvisation. Once, when the girl could not get
back to the pasture at night, she used her alpenhorn to communicate
that fact to her lover and ask him to look after the baby. This legend
is found all over Sweden in very slightly modified form.</p>

<p>To the old legend Strindberg has added the still more ancient Montecchi
and Capuletti theme from "Romeo and Juliet," making the two lovers the
offspring of mutually jealous and hostile families, and thereby giving
the play the tragical twist which his mood required. How he was turned
in this direction I don't know, but his work on the historical play,
"Gustavus Vasa"&mdash;it was written in 1899, and "The Bridal Crown" seems
to have been completed in the winter of 1900-1&mdash;had taken his mind to
Dalecarlia, where its first act is laid. And the idea of a play built
on Swedish folk-themes seems to have been long present in his mind.</p>

<p>For folk-colour as well as for local verisimilitude, he drew freely
both on Dybeck and on other repositories of old Swedish lore and
legend and superstition. One of the beauties of the play is that so
many of the extranatural figures and elements introduced are common
to the whole country. The Neck, or the Man of the Rapids, or the
Brookman (<i>Necken, Forskarlen</i>, or <i>Bäckamannen</i>) exists in popular
fancy wherever a peasant has put his plough into Swedish soil. He
is a creature of the thousand rivers and brooks that beribbon the
land from the arctic circle down to the fertile planes of Scania, and
always he is associated with an unusual gift of music and with the
fallen angel's longing for the lost Paradise. From Norrland to Scania
is told the anecdote of the tot who heard the Neck sing the song
used by Strindberg&mdash;"I am hoping, I am hoping that my Redeemer still
liveth"&mdash;and who called out to him: "There is no Redeemer for you." On
returning home, the child told his parents of what had happened and
was ordered to go back with a less discouraging message to the wailing
spirit of the waters.</p>

<p>The <i>Midwife</i>, half human, half extranatural, is another familiar
figure, mostly called the Wood-Imp (<i>Skogsrå</i>). The queer snatches
uttered by her from time to time are old Swedish riddles or
"guess-rhymes," which Strindberg also found in Dybeck's work, and which
he has employed very effectively as spells or incantations. That quaint
dualistic revenant, which is called the <i>Mewler</i> as an apparition,
and the <i>Mocker</i> as a bodiless voice, exists in the imagination of
the people all over Sweden. It is a creation of the moral instinct,
designed for the discouragement of poor maidens who have born a child
"in hiding," as the old phrase puts it, and who may be tempted into
ridding themselves of such a burden&mdash;a crime that has figured too
frequently in the criminal annals of the country.</p>

<p>The word <i>Myling</i>, which I have had to translate as <i>Mewler,</i> is said
to come from a verb meaning to kill, to choke, to bury, or to cover
up. It is related to <i>mylla</i>, mould, however, and when we find the
same term, <i>mylingar, Mewlings</i>, applied to the relatives of <i>Kersti</i>,
this characterises them not as "murtherlings," as Strindberg's German
translator would have it, but as "mouldings," as people delving in the
soil. In the original text, the name applied both to the apparition of
<i>Kersti's</i> dead baby and to her relatives is the same. I have thought
this too confusing for English-speaking readers, and have made two
terms to get the needed dearness and distinction.</p>

<p>It remains finally to say a word about the keystone to the whole
dramatic conflict in the play&mdash;the desire of <i>Kersti</i> to wear a crown
at her wedding&mdash;to be a "crown-bride," as the Swedish phrase and the
name of the original text both have it. The chief ornaments of a
Swedish bride have always been the crown, the wreath, and the veil&mdash;and
so they are to this very day. The wreath is generally made out of
myrtle. The crown is nowadays almost invariably made out of the same
material. But it used to be of metal, richly ornamented, and kept ready
for use in every country church throughout the land. It was another
device meant to encourage morality, the convention being that only
a chaste young woman could wear the crown at her wedding&mdash;only one
"worthy" of it, as the old phrase had-it. To go to church without that
ornament was, of course, a most humiliating confession, and tended to
detract largely from the riotous joy of the festivity which the Swedish
peasants have always placed above all others&mdash;the wedding. Originally
the crown also served another purpose, however. It was, as I have
already said, kept in the church and lent only with the sanction of the
clergy. In other words, it was reserved for the bride whose relatives
consented to have a church wedding at a time when the sacramental
character of the ceremony had not yet become popularly recognised. For
ages the Swedish wedding was wholly a secular ceremony based on the old
custom of bride-barter, and it took the Catholic Church many centuries
to turn it into a religious rite.</p>

<p>There are a few minor points that need some clearing up, too. The
position of <i>Kersti's</i> father, the <i>Soldier</i>, must be a puzzle to
non-Swedish readers. The presence of the picture of King Charles XV on
the wall of the <i>Soldier's</i> cottage indicates that the action takes
place in the eighteen-sixties, before the reorganisation of the Swedish
army on the basis of universal conscription had been carried out. At
that time each province had to furnish one or more regiments. The
maintenance of this soldiery fell directly on the small landholders,
and from two to ten of these formed a <i>rote</i> or "file" having to
employ, equip, and maintain one soldier. Each soldier had a cottage
and a small patch of soil furnished him by the men responsible for his
up-keep. Under such circumstances the soldier would seem likely to fall
into the position of a servant living under his masters, but that was
not at all the case. The warlike qualities and traditions of the nation
probably counteracted tendencies in that direction. Instead the soldier
became one of the recognised honoratiores of his district, ranking next
to the sexton and often filling the place of that functionary when the
office was vacant.</p>

<p>The use of the name of Krummedikke in connection with the lake is
a mystery I have not been able to clear up. The noble family of
Krummedige or Krummedike belonged originally in the duchy of Holstein,
but moved from there into Denmark and spread gradually into southern
Sweden and Norway. During the period of Sweden's union with Denmark
and Norway two members of that family held the famous old fortress
of Baahus (now Bohus) on behalf of the Danish king. Other members
controlled fortified places in Småland and the province of Halland
along the west coast of present Sweden. But there is no record of any
Krummedike having a "castle" in the northern part of Sweden. Whether
legends connected with this family have actually spread from southern
Sweden to Dalecarlia or the name, simply happened to catch Strindberg's
fancy I cannot tell.</p>

<p>The play in its entirety is one of the most impersonal Strindberg ever
wrote. Echoes of his private life are very rare&mdash;which is remarkable,
considering how plentiful they are in such a work as the historical
drama "Gustavus Vasa." In this respect "The Bridal Crown" connects
logically with Strindberg's novels and stories from the islands outside
of Stockholm: "The People at Hemsö," "Fisher Folks," and "At the Edge
of the Sea." It seems that nothing helped more to take him out of
himself and his morbid introspection than a study of the life of the
common people.</p>

<p>How successful he was in that study is indicated by the wide popularity
of the novels and stories in question as well as by the stage history
of "The Bridal Crown." This play has been one of the most frequently
produced of all his dramatic works. The first performance took place
on September 14, 1907, at the Swedish Theatre, Stockholm, and since
that time it has been played more than one hundred times in Stockholm
alone&mdash;which is a great deal in Sweden.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The list of characters will suffice to indicate what a weird thing "The
Spook Sonata" is. Rarely has Strindberg's peculiar fancy carried him
further without bringing him to outright disaster. Mingling extreme
realism of portrayal with a symbolism that frequently borders on the
extravagant and the impossible, he has nevertheless produced a work
that bites into the consciousness of the reader and challenges his
thought to an unusual degree. The best characterisation of the play as
a whole might be to call it a symbolistic mosaic pieced together with
fragments of real life.</p>

<p>Reminiscences of the author's own life in all its periods recur
constantly, and yet the play cannot be called autobiographical in any
narrow sense. Not even its general tendency&mdash;if it can be said to have
one&mdash;is particularly tied up with Strindberg's view of his own fate.
No, the play is in all its aspects a generalisation along the lines
of "The Dream Play," but brought nearer to the level and superficial
appearance of every-day life.</p>

<p>One of its purposes is to illustrate the mysterious relationship
between seemingly disconnected things and events which Strindberg
during his latest period was so prone to discover everywhere.&mdash;When in
this super-Swedenborgian mood, he was inclined to regard the slightest
incident of daily life as a mere symbol meant to shadow or foreshadow
vaster incidents on higher levels. It would be dangerous to accept his
readings of life in this mood as so many formulations of truth, but,
on the other hand, it would be unwise to discard them as meaningless.
What must be remembered first and last in the study of Strindberg's
work is that he was primarily, if not wholly, a bearer of suggestions
rather than of final truths. We cannot go to him for knowledge of what
life actually is, but we may be sure of never reading one of his pages
without finding some new angle of approach, the use of which will help
our own thought to enlarge our knowledge of actual life. Those who
demand predigested thought will always be lost in the mazes of his
irresponsible fancy. Those who ask nothing more of literature than to
be set thinking will always find him one of the most fruitful writers
produced by modern times.</p>

<p>For this very reason it would be futile to attempt any explanatory
analysis of "The Spook Sonata." There must, in fact, be a separate
analysis of that kind for every thinking reader. One may say, of
course, that its name as well as the strange function which forms
its central scene, points to an interpretation of all human life as a
ghostly reflection of wasted and buried possibilities. But there is
charity as well as bitterness in the play, and it seems to preach the
lesson that we owe tolerance to every man but him who thinks himself
better than the rest. It warns, too, against that interference with
other lives which seems to have been one of the haunting spectres of
Strindberg's own existence. In other words, the play may be regarded as
a final passionate expression of his will to live his own life in his
own way and of his resentment against real or fancied efforts to balk I
that will.</p>

<p>Dramatically this play is well worthy of study, It contains some points
that, whether successful or no in this particular connection, should
not be passed over by future playwrights. Such a point, for instance,
is the continued presence on the stage of several dumb characters
during almost the entire first scene. I do not know whether it will
come home to readers of the play that, while the conversation is going
on between the <i>Student</i> and <i>Old Hummel</i>, for example, the <i>Janitress</i>
and the <i>Dark Lady</i> are all the time present in the background as
living reminders of the secret threads of human life underlying the
conflict between the two men that do the talking. And the idea of
trying to render simultaneous portrayal of life within and without a
human habitation has again been tried by Strindberg in this play with
very remarkable and suggestive results.</p>

<p>There are several signs which indicate that Strindberg changed his plan
of the play while he was writing it. There is one character present
on the list of characters in the Swedish text that never appears&mdash;the
<i>Janitor</i>. On the other hand, that list does not contain the name of
the <i>Cook</i>, who plays such a strange part in the final scene&mdash;a sort of
infernalised Greek chorus with a Japanese soy bottle for its Dionysian
emblem. The arrangement of the stage directions in the Swedish original
indicates, too, that he intended a single setting to serve for the
whole play. He hoped probably to be able to let the action laid within
the house be seen from the outside, but, warned by his strong sense of
theatrical feasibility, he changed his plans unhesitatingly, and with
them his scenery.</p>

<p>Several of the minor themes running through the play may to the reader
seem not only minor but hopelessly trivial. I am thinking principally
of the constantly recurring charge against servants that they take
the nourishment out of food before serving it to their masters. This
suspicion seems to have been one of Strindberg's fixed ideas, occurring
in almost every work where the relationship between masters and
servants is at all mentioned. I think he has harped too much on this
theme, both in "The Spook Sonata" and elsewhere. I think, too, that he
is wrong in placing the responsibility with the servants. On the other
hand, I think one of his services is that he works with modern science
to bring us a better realisation of the dose interrelation between
the material basis of our existences and the more important spiritual
overtones.</p>

<p>"The Spook Sonata" was written and published in 1907. It was played for
the first time on January 27, 1908, at the Intimate Theatre, Stockholm,
reaching a total of twelve performances.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The little scene named "The First Warning" is frankly autobiographical.
It relates an actual incident from Strindberg's first marriage, to
which, I think, he makes reference in "A Fool's Confession"&mdash;a work, by
the bye, which should really be named "A Fool's Plea" in English.</p>

<p>In spite of sinister undertones, "The First Warning" is distinctly
a comedy, and practically the only short thing in a lighter vein
written by Strindberg. At first he named it "The First Tooth," but he
had adopted the present title before the original publication&mdash;with
three other one-act plays&mdash;occurred, in 1893. In Germany the play is
known under the name "Signs of Autumn" (<i>Herbstzeichen</i>). Beginning on
September 10, 1910, it was given eight times in all at the Intimate
Theatre, Stockholm, but long before that time it had been played a
number of times on various German stages.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>King Gustavus I, founder of the Vasa dynasty, which reigned over Sweden
until 1818, has rightly been called the "father" of his country and the
builder of modern Sweden. He finished the war of liberation, by which
the hampering and unsatisfactory union between Sweden and the other two
Scandinavian kingdoms was finally severed. But he did much more. He
reorganised the whole country, in all its departments, on such a basis
of efficiency that it became able to play the part of a great European
power for more than a century. Some have pictured him as a sort of
superman. Others have called him a mere country squire, applying the
methods of stable and barn to a whole country. Both those views of him
are probably correct as well as incorrect. He was undoubtedly first of
all an able and conscientious peasant on a large scale, but as such he
was very much in place at a time when agriculture was the only source
of income that could be called national. And his cares on behalf of
commerce and mining show him to have had a very broad and foresighted
view of husbandry.</p>

<p>The figure of the first Vasa took an early hold of Strindberg's
imagination. He introduced it in the first version of his first great
play, "Master Olov." But there the king was a subordinate character&mdash;so
much so, in fact, that he did not appear at all in the final metrical
version of the play, completed in 1877. At that time Strindberg was
more interested in <i>Master Olov</i>, the dreaming idealist who placed
religious reform above political and economical reorganisation. When,
in 1899, he returned to "old King Gustav," his interest had shifted,
and in this play, said to be his greatest historical drama&mdash;and one of
the greatest of its kind in the annals of modern literature&mdash;the royal
figure dominates absolute.</p>

<p>When I first contemplated a translation of this play I feared it would
be necessary to preface it with a condensed history of Sweden during
the early sixteenth century. Having finished my task, I find that an
elaborate historical introduction would merely be a duplication of the
work done by the playwright. Barring a few minor points that have been
illuminated by notes, all the history needed for the understanding of
the play will be found within the play itself. The truth of the matter
is that Strindberg was not writing history but poetry, and that he
was more anxious to portray human character than to set forth all too
familiar historical events.</p>

<p>He portrayed his main character in more than one way and sense,
however. The <i>King</i>, as we find him in the drama, is a wonderfully
vivid and faithful reconstruction of a great man that has writ
himself in large letters on the map of his country. But he is also
a symbolisation of a type that will always remain one of the most
fascinating of all that people the earth: that of the ruler who is
conscious both his mission and of the price that must be paid for its
fulfilment. The problem of Strindberg's play might be said to be this:
granted such a mission, how much has a man the right to pay for its
proper fulfilment? And as behoves a poet Strindberg has brought this
problem to no triumphant "Q.E.D." His ambiguous, yet tremendously
significant, answer seems to be: "Such a man has the right to do
whatever his mission demands, even though it may go against his grain
as an individual, but he must be humble about it and not confuse
himself with Providence." <i>Gustavus</i> is humbled and made to suffer, not
because of this or that act, but because of an inclination to consider
his own mission the only one in sight.</p>

<p>A few words need to be said about the chronology of the play. In
accordance with his theories in regard to historical playwriting
Strindberg has dealt very freely with dates and facts. The play
occupies a period of about two years, which length of time separates
the first act from the four last. These take place within a few days.
The historical events that enter as material into the play were spread
over nearly twenty years, and Strindberg has not hesitated to introduce
them in reversed order either. This license must be considered in
the light of what I have already said about his intentions. His main
concern was to show how the principal character would act under certain
given circumstances, and to use those circumstances in the manner most
apt to throw light on the character in question. And in this respect he
has undoubtedly been successful.</p>

<p>The Swedes think so, at least. "Gustavus Vasa" has drawn grudging
approval from Strindberg's worst enemies among his own countrymen. The
first performance of the play, which took place on October 17, 1899,
at the Swedish Theatre, Stockholm, turned at the time into a national
event. The play has since then been revived several times, particularly
in connection with the celebration of its author's sixtieth and
sixty-third birthday anniversaries, in 1909 and 1912. In all, the play
has been performed about one hundred times in Stockholm alone, and it
has been given on several German stages with striking success.</p>

<p>A word should be said concerning the spelling of Swedish names used in
this volume. It can hardly be called a system at all. It is neither
Swedish nor English. It is a frank compromise, designed exclusively to
make the reading of the plays as easy as possible to English-speaking
readers. Some time in the future, when the knowledge of the
Scandinavian literatures and languages has reached a more advanced
stage in this country, I should like to see a revised edition with the
original Swedish spelling of all names preserved throughout.</p>

<blockquote>

<p><i>A hill pasture in Dalecarlia. A hut of rough-hewn boards,
painted red, Stands at the left. Beside it grow two birches
with trunks that are white clear down to the ground</i>.</p>

<p><i>On the right-hand side appears a sloping hillside covered
with spruces. The hillside is cut by a large brook forming a
waterfall. At the foot of it is a tarn covered by water-lilies.
The background shows a big lake bordered by blue hills. A
church is visible across the lake</i>.</p>

<p><i>A grindstone set in a wooden frame stands in the foreground by
the corner of the hut</i>.</p>

<p><i>It is Sunday evening, about sunset time</i>.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">KERSTI'S MOTHER</span> <i>sits on a wooden block outside the hut,
smoking her pipe</i>.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">KERSTI</span> <i>enters with an alpenhorn in her hand. She stops in
front of her</i> <span class="small-c">MOTHER</span>.</p></blockquote>


<p><span class="small-c">MOTHER</span>. Where have you been all this time, daughter?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">KERSTI</span>. In the woods, mother.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">MOTHER</span>. Picking strawberries, I suppose. Your lips are so red.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">KERSTI</span>. Why did you call me, mother?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">MOTHER</span>. The woods were full of noises, child, and of stealthy
footfalls. Could it be the bear?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">KERSTI</span>. Can't tell.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">MOTHER</span>. I thought I heard the strokes of an axe, but maybe I was
mistaken.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">KERSTI</span>. The bear uses no axe, mother.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">MOTHER</span>. Why dressed up in your best, daughter?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">KERSTI</span>. It's Sunday, mother.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">MOTHER</span>. There is milk on your tucker, child. Have you been milking
May-dew or Starbright?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">KERSTI</span>. Could I but milk the stars&mdash;and the moon, O!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">MOTHER</span>. While it's night, O!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">KERSTI</span>. Day and night!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">MOTHER</span>. Night and day!&mdash;Yes, I know! Beware of the bear!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">KERSTI</span>. I can hear the cock crowing and the dog barking, the gun
banging and the cart clanking, and the oars saying "duck-duck" in the
rowlocks.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">MOTHER</span>. Whose cock do you mean, and whose dog?</p>

heavy as a pall, and downward goes my path now&mdash;ever downward! But you
must stay to watch the curds. And trust me to see if you let the fire
go out.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">KERSTI</span>. Trust me to see that the fire won't go out, mother.</p>

<blockquote>

<p><i>A strong wind springs up. The centre of the stage grows dark,
but the sun is still shining on the tops of spruces on the
hillside</i>.</p>

<p><i>Very faintly at first, then more and more clearly, the yells
and cries of a gang of game beaters are heard. These are
followed by the snapping of branches, the baying of hounds, the
trampling of horses in trot and gallop, the cracking of guns,
the snarling of rattles, the crashing of trees that fall, and,
above all, the constantly rising roar of the waterfall</i>.</p>

<p><i>Finally a canon is sounded by ten hunting-horns, the first
horn repeating its theme while the rest join in one by one.
[See musical appendix, Melody No</i>. 11.]</p>

<p><i>Badly frightened</i>, <span class="small-c">KERSTI</span> <i>stands staring in every direction
while the noise lasts. When it has died away in the distance
and the woods are silent again, she brings bunches of spruce
branches and spreads them on the ground, covering them at last
with a brightly coloured rag carpet. Next she fetches two young
spruce-trees that have been stripped of branches and bark, so
that only their tops remain green. These she places beside the
door of the hut, one on either side. Then she goes to the tarn
and picks a number of white water-lilies, which she binds into
a wreath</i>.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">MATS</span> <i>enters from the left, carrying a baby in a cradle of
leather with straps attached to it</i>.</p></blockquote>


<p><span class="small-c">KERSTI</span>. Baby, baby darling! Is he still asleep?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">MATS</span>. Indeed he is!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">KERSTI</span>. Bring him here, and we'll let the trees rock him.</p>

<p><i>They hang the cradle between the two birches that are swayed
gently by the wind</i>.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="small-c">KERSTI</span>. [<i>Humming</i>] "Birches nod in the blowing breeze, but baby
slumbers in perfect peace.".... Did you hear the hunt, Mats?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">MATS</span>. No hunt at this time of day, girl!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">KERSTI</span>. But I heard it!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">MATS</span>. Hardly!&mdash;What did your mother have to say?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">KERSTI</span>. She bothered me until I thought she would bother the life out
of me.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">MATS</span>. Yes, dear, there can be no peace or happiness for us until our
union has been hallowed and our baby baptised.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">KERSTI</span>. As long as the old folk resist there can be no wedding. But we
must pray the Lord to bless our union before we give baby a name.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">MATS</span>. So we have agreed, and now it may as well be done.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">KERSTI</span>. Everything is ready, as you see.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">MATS</span>. It's well done, but&mdash;we're a sorry couple for all that, and a
sorry wedding we're having.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">KERSTI</span>. Let the Lord look into our minds and hearts, and if they hold
no evil&mdash;what matters the rest? Have you brought the Book?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">MATS</span>. I have. But are you sure, dear, that what we mean to do is not
sinful?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">KERSTI</span>. Why should it be? Don't you know that the midwife can baptise
in case of need?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">MATS</span>. Well, that's the midwife!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">KERSTI</span>. [<i>Putting the wreath on her head</i>] Let us begin!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">MATS</span>. In the name of the Lord! And may we never come to regret it!

<p><span class="small-c">MATS</span>. And what have we to eat, dear.</p>

guessed what folk they were.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">MATS</span>. Better not, maybe!... Look at the cradle&mdash;going as if it could

<p><span class="small-c">MOTHER</span>. [<i>Pointing to the cradle</i>] What have you there?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">KERSTI</span>. Not so very.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">MOTHER</span>. And inside the cradle?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">KERSTI</span>. Small wash&mdash;not for small ones.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">KERSTI</span>. No, really?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">MOTHER</span>. They say that Mats is to have the mill.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">KERSTI</span> [<i>Rising</i>] Is it true?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">MOTHER</span>. As true as it is that rashness always gets into trouble.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">KERSTI</span>. So Mats gets the mill? Then he will marry, I guess?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">MOTHER</span>. They talk of that, too.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">KERSTI</span>. Whom do you think?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">MOTHER</span>. Whoever it be that his fancy will take&mdash;the crown she must

<p><span class="small-c">KERSTI</span>. [<i>Walking back and forth restlessly</i>] You know, it was foretold

<p><span class="small-c">KERSTI</span>. [<i>Startled</i>] The Sheriff?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">MIDWIFE</span>. Yes, the Sheriff. He is a very remarkable man, and I have
heard of no one who knows the law as he does, from cover to cover....
You and I could never get all that into our heads, but&mdash;there is
one chapter I have to know by heart, being a midwife.... And a

furthermore?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">KERSTI</span>. To hook what's big, you must overlook what's less.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">KERSTI</span>. Who is that?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">MATS</span>. If you know, why don't you tell?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">KERSTI</span>. Because I want you to tell.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">MATS</span>. It's the midwife. Was that what you said?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">KERSTI</span>. I said nothing, but you did&mdash;and, as you know, I do what you
say.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">MATS</span>. I have my doubts.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">KERSTI</span>. But what you said I have done already. The baby can't stay
in the woods. It must have shelter when the nights grow cold. And if
anything should happen, then comes&mdash;the Sheriff!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">MATS</span>. The Sheriff, you say? Yes, so he does!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">KERSTI</span>. [<i>Leaping to her feet</i>] Is he coming, you say?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">MATS</span>. Yes, if something should happen.... Well, where's the midwife to
be found?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">KERSTI</span>. Would you like to call her?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">MATS</span>. I wish she were here!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">KERSTI</span>. And what do you want her to do?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">MATS</span>. Give the baby a home.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">KERSTI</span>. With whom?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">MATS</span>. With herself.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">KERSTI</span>. For how long?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">MATS</span>. Till the wedding is over.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">KERSTI</span>. But if he were taken sick while with her?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">MATS</span>. Better than have him freeze in the woods&mdash;better than have him
freeze to death! Take a look at the cradle. I think I heard him!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">KERSTI</span>. No, he's asleep....</p>

<p><span class="small-c">MATS</span>. Hush&mdash;I heard him.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">KERSTI</span>. No, you didn't!</p>

him? Oh, Kersti, we should never have done what we have!</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">SECOND SCENE</p>


<blockquote>

<p><i>The living-room of the mill. Everything is covered by white
dust. In the background, on the right-hand side, is an open
trap-door, showing part of the water-wheel. The end of the
flour chute, with a bag attached to it, is protruding from the
right wall not far from the trap-door. Near it appears a lever
used for starting and stopping the water-wheel.</i></p>

<p><i>Large gates occupy the centre of the real wall. Heavy wooden
shutters dose another opening farther to the left and half-way
from the floor</i>.</p>

<p><i>In the foreground, at the right, is a huge open fireplace, in
which a coal-fire is burning. An iron pot is hanging over the
fire. On the left-hand side appear a bedstead, a hand-loom, a
bobbin, a red, and a spinning-wheel. There is a door in the
right wall</i>.</p>

<p><i>The following members of the family are seated in a circle in
front of the fireplace: the</i> <span class="small-c">GRANDFATHER</span>; <i>the</i> <span class="small-c">GRANDMOTHER</span>;
<i>the</i> <span class="small-c">FATHER</span> <i>and</i> <span class="small-c">MOTHER</span> <i>of</i> <span class="small-c">MATS</span>; <i>his sisters</i>, <span class="small-c">BRITA</span>, <i>who

is still a child; and his brother</i>, <span class="small-c">LIT-MATS</span>, <i>who is also a
mere boy. All are smoking out of small pipes with iron bowls
and looking very serious</i>. <span class="small-c">BRITA</span> <i>is plaiting a chain out of
human hair</i>. <span class="small-c">LIT-KAREN</span> <i>and</i> <span class="small-c">LIT-MATS</span> <i>are playing with two
dolls</i>.</p></blockquote>


<p><span class="small-c">BRITA</span>. [<i>To</i> <span class="small-c">LIT-KAREN</span>] Where did you get the doll?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">LIT-KAREN</span>. Kersti gave it to me.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">BRITA</span>. [<i>Taking the doll from her</i>] Away with it! [<i>To</i> Lit-Mats] Where
did you get your doll?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">LIT-MATS</span>. Kersti gave it to me.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">BRITA</span>. [<i>Taking the doll</i>] Out with it!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">FATHER</span>. Hush! Hush! Grandfather is thinking. [<i>Silence</i>.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">MOTHER</span>. [<i>To</i> <span class="small-c">BRITA</span>] What are you doing?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">BRITA</span>. A watch-chain, but there is hardly hair enough.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">MOTHER</span>. Where can you get any?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">BRITA</span>. I know where it ought to be pulled.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">MOTHER</span>. Horses pull.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">BRITA</span>. Hens are picked, pigs give bristles, and maidens are
combed.&mdash;Combed hair is good, but cut is better.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">FATHER</span>. Hush, hush, grandfather is thinking. [<i>Silence</i>.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ANNA</span>. [<i>In a low voice to</i> <span class="small-c">BRITA</span>] What is he thinking of?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">BRITA</span>. You'll hear by and by. And all will have to swallow.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ANNA</span>. Is it about Mats? [<span class="small-c">BRITA</span> <i>makes no answer</i>] And Kersti? Will
there be a wedding?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">FATHER</span>. Hush, hush, grandfather is thinking. [<i>Silence</i>.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ANNA</span>. [<i>To</i> <span class="small-c">BRITA</span>] I'll give you some of my hair.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">BRITA</span>. Not the right colour.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ANNA</span>. Who's got it? [<span class="small-c">BRITA</span> <i>does not answer</i>] Is it Kersti you mean?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">BRITA</span>. Don't mention her. [<i>Silence</i>.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">GRANDMOTHER</span>. [<i>To</i> <span class="small-c">GRANDFATHER</span>] Have you thought it out?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">GRANDFATHER</span>. [<i>Who has been sitting with the Bible and the hymn-book in
his lap, lost in thought, wakes up</i>] I have! [<i>He opens the hymn-book
at haphazard and says to the others</i>] It is No. 278, the fourth verse:
"All at birth and death." Let us have it!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALL</span>. [<i>Read in unison like children at school</i>]</p>

<p  style="margin-left: 25%;">

</p>

<p><span class="small-c">GRANDFATHER</span>. It is settled! "He that hath an ear, let him hear."&mdash;Is it
settled?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">GRANDMOTHER</span>. Not yet.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">FATHER</span>. Not quite.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">MOTHER</span>. The Lord beholdeth!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">BRITA</span>. What does the Scripture, say?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ANNA</span>. "Doth God pervert judgment, or doth the Almighty pervert justice?"</p>

<p><span class="small-c">LIT-KAREN</span>. What do you want me to say?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">GRANDFATHER</span>. You must give us your advice, child, although we may not
take it. Out of the mouth of babes may come the truth.... Shall Kersti
have Mats?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">LIT-KAREN</span>. If they want each other.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">GRANDFATHER</span>. Well spoken! [<i>To</i> <span class="small-c">LIT-MATS</span>] And you, Lit-Mats?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">LIT-MATS</span>. [<i>With his fingers in his mouth</i>] I want my doll!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">GRANDFATHER</span>. And Mats wants his. Shall he have her?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">LIT-MATS</span>. If it is Kersti, he may, for she gave me the doll.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">BRITA</span>. Listen to him!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">GRANDFATHER</span>. Let us search the Scripture. [<i>He opens the Bible and
reads</i>] Genesis, thirty-fourth chapter and eighth verse. "And Hamor
communed with them, saying, The soul of my son Shechem longeth for your
daughter: I pray you give her him to wife." Is that enough?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">GRANDMOTHER</span>. Enough and to spare!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">FATHER</span>. There wasn't anything about the mill.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">MOTHER</span>. Let His will be done!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">BRITA</span>. [<i>Abruptly</i>] Amen.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ANNA</span>. Verily, it shall be done!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">LIT-KAREN</span>. I like Kersti because she's nice.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">LIT-MATS</span>. Me, too!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">FATHER</span>. Hush, hush, grandfather is thinking. [<i>Silence</i>.</p>

bundle of papers from the box, and turns to the</i> <span class="small-c">FATHER</span> <i>again</i>] Let

<p><span class="small-c">SHERIFF</span>. [<i>Enters, dressed in uniform</i>] The peace of God be with you!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALL</span>. [<i>Rising</i>] And his blessing on you!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">GRANDFATHER</span>. It is I who have called you, Stig Matsson, and you know
the reason. Kersti Margaret Hansdaughter&mdash;[<i>He sighs</i>]&mdash;is to become
the wife of Mats Anders Larsson, my grandson. The two families have
fought and fumed at each other for a long time&mdash;all too long! At
this late hour I have come to feel that an end should be put to all
strife and ill will before my eyes are closed and I am carried to my
last rest. Take a look at these papers. [<i>He hands the bundle to the</i>
<span class="small-c">SHERIFF</span>, <i>who opens it and glances at some of the papers</i>] They are
legal documents, deeds, wills, receipts, authorisations&mdash;belonging to
suits that have been settled or are still unsettled. Have you looked
them over?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">SHERIFF</span>. I have.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">GRANDFATHER</span>. [<i>Takes back the bundle</i>] All right! Then I shall throw
them into the fire. There is a time to hate and a time to love. The
time of hatred must come to an end I am longing for peace. Therefore,
I beg you, my next of kin, to regard all that has happened in the
past as if it had not happened at all&mdash;and I ask you: Will you forget
everything, and will you meet your new relatives without grudge or
guile, and greet them as friends? Answer me!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALL</span>. We will!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">GRANDFATHER</span>. Then I shall let the fire consume what is left of past
evils. [<i>He throws the bundle of papers into the fire, pulls the iron
lid in front of the grate, and opens three small ventilators in the
lid</i>] Let us be seated!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">GRANDFATHER</span>. When is the wedding to be?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">MATS</span>. In a fortnight, as soon as the banns have been read the third
time.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">GRANDFATHER</span>. What is the hurry?</p>

<blockquote>

<p><span class="small-c">KERSTI</span> <i>shows evidence of being offended</i>.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="small-c">GRANDFATHER</span>. Maybe you have!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">MATS</span>. [<i>To his relatives</i>] Have you no word to say to Kersti? [<i>Pause</i>]
Not one of you?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">SHERIFF</span>. [<i>Goes to</i> <span class="small-c">KERSTI</span> <i>and takes her by the hands with evident

<blockquote>

<p><i>Panic-stricken</i>, <span class="small-c">KERSTI</span> <i>tries to tear herself loose</i>.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="small-c">SHERIFF</span>. You are not afraid of me, are you?&mdash;Oh, no!&mdash;Look me in the
face, Kersti. I have dandled you on my knees when you were a little
child, and I have held your pretty head in my hands.... Yes, you have a
very pretty head, and a forehead that makes me think of a bull. That's
why you are having your own way now, I suppose.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>[<i>He lets go of her</i>.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="small-c">GRANDFATHER</span>. Let us leave the young ones alone!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">BRITA</span>. [<i>Who is the last to leave, spits scornfully as she passes</i>
<span class="small-c">KERSTI</span>] Fie!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">MATS</span>. [<i>Spitting in the same way</i>] Fie yourself!</p>

<blockquote>

<p><span class="small-c">KERSTI</span> <i>and</i> <span class="small-c">MATS</span> <i>are left alone</i>.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="small-c">MATS</span>. I hope you will feel at home with me, Kersti!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">KERSTI</span>. With you, yes!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">MATS</span>. What have you to do with the others?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">KERSTI</span>. That's the question.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">MATS</span>. You are not marrying the family.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">KERSTI</span>. But into it.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">MATS</span>. Of course, we are not very soft or cuddlesome.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">KERSTI</span>. That's plain.... Is this the place where we are to live?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">MATS</span>. Yes, what do you think of it?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">KERSTI</span>. Everything is white....</p>

<p><span class="small-c">MATS</span>. It's the flour, you see. Do you object?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">KERSTI</span>. And damp....</p>

<p><span class="small-c">MATS</span>. It's the mill-race....</p>

<p><span class="small-c">KERSTI</span>. And cold, too....</p>

<p><span class="small-c">MATS</span>. It's the water....</p>

<p><span class="small-c">KERSTI</span>. Shall we have new furniture?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">MATS</span>. There will be nothing new. Everything is handed down from one
generation to another.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">KERSTI</span>. But we can sweep, can't we?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">MATS</span>. No, we can't! The dust in a mill is like the coating in a pipe.
Mustn't be touched!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">KERSTI</span>. Is that the wheel?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">MATS</span>. That's the wheel.</p>

<blockquote>

<p><i>He pulls the lever, whereupon the rushing of the water through
the race is heard, and the wheel begins to turn</i>.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="small-c">KERSTI</span>. Ugh! Have we to listen to that noise?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">MATS</span>. It's ours! And we should be thankful as long as we hear it,
because that means we have grist for the mill.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">KERSTI</span>. And the sun never gets here?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">MATS</span>. Never! How could it?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">KERSTI</span>. And nothing grows here&mdash;except that green stuff on the wheel.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">MATS</span>. But we catch eels here and lampreys.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">KERSTI</span>. Ugh! I like it better in the pasture, where the wind is
blowing....</p>

<p><span class="small-c">MATS</span>. And the birches rock....</p>

<p><span class="small-c">KERSTI</span>. [<i>Covering her face with the apron and weeping</i>] Must I live in
a place like this, beneath the water, at the bottom of the sea?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">MATS</span>. I was born here.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">KERSTI</span>. And here we are to die&mdash;O!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">MATS</span>. Why "O"?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">KERSTI</span>. Stop the wheel at least.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">MATS</span>. Well, if you can't get along with the wheel, then....</p>

<p><span class="small-c">KERSTI</span>. [<i>Opening a trap-door in the floor</i>] What's down here?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">MATS</span>. The river.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">KERSTI</span>. Please stop that wheel!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">MATS</span>. [<i>Labours with the lever, but is unable to stop the wheel]</i> Well!
There must be mischief abroad!&mdash;It won't stop!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">KERSTI</span>. I shall die here!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">MATS</span>. I must go outside to stop it! There is mischief abroad, I tell
you!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">KERSTI</span>. And at home?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">MATS</span>. Oh, dear!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">KERSTI</span>. "Meow, said the cat."[1]</p>

<p><span class="small-c">MATS</span>. What is the matter?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">KERSTI</span>. Merely that I have got what I wanted.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">MATS</span>. And it was not worth having? [<i>The noise made by the wheel has
become, deafening, and the wheel itself has begun to turn in the

<blockquote>

<p><i>The eve of the wedding. The house of</i> <span class="small-c">KERSTI'S</span> <i>parents</i>.</p>

<p><i>Above the door in the rear hangs a smalt tin plate on
which are painted the</i> <span class="small-c">SOLDIER'S</span> <i>regimental number and the
coat-of-arms of Dalecarlia. There is a window on either side
of the door, both filled with potted plants. The floor is of
pine boards, full of knot-holes and nail-heads, but scrubbed
immaculately dean</i>.</p>

<p><i>Half-way down the left wall is an open fireplace with a hood.
On the same side, nearer the footlights, stands a wooden seat
covered with brightly coloured home-made draperies</i>.</p>

<p><i>Against the opposite wall stands a chest of drawers surmounted
by a mirror, over which a white veil has been draped. A pair of
candlesticks and a few simple ornaments are arranged in front
of the mirror. A table and a wooden seat are placed between the
chest and the footlights. On the wall above this seat hangs
the</i> <span class="small-c">SOLDIER'S</span> <i>old-fashioned musket, with stock of birch wood,
stained yellow, red leather sling, and percussion-lock. His
chaco, cartridge-case, and white bandoleer with bayonet are
grouped around the musket. Below appears a portrait of King
Charles XV of Sweden in full uniform</i>.</p>

<p><i>A landscape with stacks of sheaves in the fields can be seen
through the windows and the open door in the rear</i>.</p>

<p><i>When the curtain rises, a maid servant is at work by the
fireplace scouring and polishing copper pans, iron pots, and
coffee-kettles</i>.</p>

<p><i>The</i> <span class="small-c">VERGER</span> <i>is seated at the table on the right-hand side
engaged in polishing the brass numbers of the hymn-board,
which is lying on the table beside him. There lies also the
collection-bag of red velvet with embroideries in silver and
a small bell attached to the bottom of it for the rousing of
sleeping worshippers</i>.</p>

<p><i>The</i> <span class="small-c">SOLDIER</span>, <i>in undress uniform and forage-cap, is seated at
the same table, looking over some papers on which he is making
notes with a pencil, the point of which he wets from time to
time</i>.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">LIT-KAREN</span> <i>and</i> <span class="small-c">LIT-MATS</span> <i>stand beside the table, with their
chins resting on the edge of it, watching the</i> <span class="small-c">VERGER</span>. <i>Their
eyes are agog, and their fingers in their mouths. The</i> <span class="small-c">VERGER</span>
<i>smiles at them and strokes their hair from time to time. The</i>
<span class="small-c">MOTHER</span> <i>is standing by the fireplace drying a couple of towels.
As the curtain rises, the merry singing of girls is heard from
the outside, but the atmosphere in the room is oppressive, and
everybody is trying to lose himself in what he has at hand,
forgetful of the rest</i>.</p></blockquote>

We should be bringing in the oats.... And it will soon be time to pick
berries....</p>

<p><span class="small-c">VERGER</span>. Yes, the dog-days are most over. You can see it on the flies;
they're kind of drowsy.... Will there be a lot of berries this year?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">SOLDIER</span>. Will those girls never come back?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">SOLDIER</span>. Well, it isn't so very hard on the infantry....</p>

you.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">KERSTI</span>. What do you mean?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">BRITA</span>. Hard to tell, isn't it?&mdash;Nice hair you've got. Can I have it, if
it should come off?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">KERSTI</span>. No, you can't!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">LIT-KAREN</span>. I'll look after Lit-Mats and see that he doesn't.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">VERGER</span>. So you're going to look after him, are you?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">MOTHER</span>. Where are you going, father?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">VERGER</span>. To the store to get the crown, which should be back from the

<p><span class="small-c">BRITA</span>. What do you fear might happen?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">MOTHER</span>. Why, they are grown-up people!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">BRITA</span>. And Kersti likes to be alone for that matter. She can't stand
having anybody look at her....</p>

<p><span class="small-c">MOTHER</span>. Now, now!</p>

more. Perhaps the crown won't fit her even? Have you tried it on?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">BRITA</span>. "Hush-a-bye, baby," I suppose you mean?... No, let us read the
Bible.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">KERSTI</span>. The Bible, you say?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">BRITA</span>. Yes&mdash;Genesis, thirty-fourth and eight.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">KERSTI</span>. About Shechem, you mean?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">BRITA</span>. Exactly, and about Dinah, for whom his heart was longing.... Do
you know who Dinah was?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">KERSTI</span>. She was the daughter of Jacob and Leah.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">BRITA</span>. That's right. And do you know what she was?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">KERSTI</span>. Is that a riddle?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">BRITA</span>. Not at all. Do you know what she was?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">KERSTI</span>. No.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">BRITA</span>. She was a little&mdash;spoiled!</p>

behind, clinging to the skirt of</i> <span class="small-c">KERSTI</span>.</p>

<p><i>It is plain that the intentions of the</i> <span class="small-c">SHERIFF</span> <i>are kindly,
and so are his words, but the more discreet he tries to be,
the more awkward he becomes, and so all his words assume an

<p><span class="small-c">SHERIFF</span>. [<i>Taking one of</i> <span class="small-c">KERSTI'S</span> <i>hands and looking her straight in
the eyes</i>] What sort of a bride is this, looking so sad when she is
getting her heart's desire? What is the matter?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">KERSTI</span>. With what?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">SHERIFF</span>. Is that the way to answer an old friend who will be a kinsman
by this hour to-morrow? There is more than one lass who envies you, and
who would like to get to the altar ahead of you to-morrow.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">KERSTI</span>. Maybe there is.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">SHERIFF</span>. And there is the new life ahead of you, in mill and kitchen.
No more running about in the woods, where "birches nod in the blowing
breeze." No more dancing in the barns on Saturday nights. You'll be
busy 'tending your pots, and watching the cradle, and having the meals
on the table when Mats comes home, and&mdash;keeping an even temper when the
dark days arrive&mdash;for after sunshine there is sure to be a little rain.
Does it scare you to find life so serious, dear? It isn't as bad as it
looks. It merely helps to make life kind of solemn.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">KERSTI</span>. Oh!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">SHERIFF</span>. What are you oh-ing about, girl?&mdash;There seems to be something
in the air that has no place in the thoughts of a young girl&mdash;something
amiss. Now, my dear, let me see if I can't straighten it out.
[<i>Jestingly</i>] The guardian of the law knows how to get the truth out of
all sorts of people. What's on your mind, dear? Has Mats been nasty to
you?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">KERSTI</span>. Oh, mercy!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">SHERIFF</span>. Has the family been playing the high-and-mighty? What have you
to do with the family anyhow?</p>

<blockquote>

<p><span class="small-c">LIT-MATS</span> <i>climbs into the lap of</i> <span class="small-c">KERSTI</span>, <i>puts his arms about

asleep</i>.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="small-c">SHERIFF</span>. Look at that little chap now! He likes his sister-in-law, and
that's a good sign. Children always know their real friends. Are you
fond of children, Kersti?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">KERSTI</span>. [<i>Suspiciously</i>] Why do you ask?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">SHERIFF</span>. That's not the right kind of an answer!... Don't you think
it's nice to have a little thing like that&mdash;to hold it on your lap
and feel how it trusts you&mdash;just as if there could never be any harm
or deceit in the bosom that shelters it.... I think he's falling
asleep. Helpless as he is, he's not afraid of trusting his sleep to a
stranger&mdash;who means nothing but well by him, I am sure.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">KERSTI</span>. Have you seen anything of Mats?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">SHERIFF</span>. He was busy with the boys making the mill ready for the dance
to-morrow. [<i>Silence</i>] It's some time since we saw a crown bride in
this place.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">KERSTI</span>. Is that so?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">SHERIFF</span>. Yes, indeed. The old ways are gone, and new ones have come
in&mdash;from the cities and the camps....</p>

<p><span class="small-c">KERSTI</span>. [<i>Pertly</i>] They used to blame the fellows who came to buy the
timber.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">SHERIFF</span>. Yes, but if it hadn't been for them, there would have been no
mill....</p>

<p><span class="small-c">KERSTI</span>. They are always putting the blame on somebody else....</p>

<p><span class="small-c">SHERIFF</span>. You are getting a nice husband, Kersti....</p>

<p><span class="small-c">KERSTI</span>. Yes, he's fine&mdash;too fine for me!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">SHERIFF</span>. That's a bitter answer to a kind word!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">KERSTI</span>. There was nothing bitter about it&mdash;nothing but the truth....</p>

<p><span class="small-c">SHERIFF</span>. Why should it be so hard for us to understand each other? It
looks almost as if you didn't want us to be friends?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">KERSTI</span>. Why do you think so?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">SHERIFF</span>. What is well meant, you take badly, and the other way around.
Well&mdash;that happens frequently when there is something amiss.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">KERSTI</span>. What's amiss?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">SHERIFF</span>. I don't know.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">KERSTI</span>. Neither do I, but it isn't customary to say things like that to
a young girl.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">SHERIFF</span>. Now, now!&mdash;Where there's no sick conscience, you don't have to
walk in your stocking feet&mdash;but, but, but....</p>

<p><span class="small-c">KERSTI</span>. Has the examination begun already?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">SHERIFF</span>. I didn't mean....</p>

<p><span class="small-c">KERSTI</span>. The&mdash;"guardian of the law" doesn't know how to talk to ladies.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">SHERIFF</span>. [<i>Sharply</i>] Kersti!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">KERSTI</span>. What is it?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">SHERIFF</span>. [<i>Looking hard at her</i>] What do you mean? <span class="small-c">KERSTI</span>. What do you
mean yourself?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">SHERIFF</span>. Lo and behold! That's just the kind of questions asked by <i>my</i>
ladies when they want to find out whether I know anything.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">KERSTI</span>. What could there be to know?</p>

<blockquote>

<p><i>The wedding. The living-room at the mill has been cleared
for the occasion. The big doors in the rear stand wide open.
Through the doorway is seen a large loft, where a number
of tables have been spread for the impending feast, of
which coffee is to form one of the principal features. The
shutters covering the rectangular opening to the left of the
main doorway are also open, disclosing a table with several
candlesticks on it. On this table the fiddlers subsequently
take up their position</i>.</p>

<p><i>The opening to the water-wheel appears to the right of the
main door. The hand-loom, the bobbin, the reel, and the
spinning-wheel have disappeared</i>.</p>

<p><i>On the floor, beneath the place reserved for the fiddlers,
stands the "old men's table," with a full equipment of jugs,
mugs, pipes, and playing-cards</i>.</p>

<p><i>A number of chairs and benches occupy the middle of the floor,
and on these are spread clean white sheets, pillow-cases, and
towels for drying</i>.</p>

<p><i>As the curtain rises, six servant-girls are busily grinding
coffee on as many hand-mills, while from the outside are heard
the ringing of church-bells and a bridal march played on
violins. When the coffee is ground, the girls begin to gather
up the linen and sing while they are doing so</i>.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">GIRLS</span>. [<i>Singing; see musical appendix, Melody No</i>. 16]</p></blockquote>

burdens of linen</i>.</p>

<p><i>The stage is left empty for a few moments, all the sounds
previously heard having died out</i>.</p>

<p><i>Then the song of the</i> <span class="small-c">NECK</span> <i>is heard from the water-wheel,

<p><i>Then the bridal march is again heard outside. The song of
the</i> <span class="small-c">NECK</span> <i>ceases, and the</i> <span class="small-c">MEWLER</span> <i>disappears, the trap-door
falling back into its wonted position</i>.</p>

fiddlers, then the bridesmaids and bridesmen. After these come
the bride and the groom, and then follow the</i> <span class="small-c">PASTOR</span>, <i>the
parents of the couple, the members of both families, friends,
and young people. Everybody seems depressed, and the entrance
is made in gloomy silence</i>.</p>

<p><i>The bride is led to a chair in the middle of the floor, placed
so that she must face the trap-door in the floor. She is very
pale and does not look up at all. The guests pass in front of
her as in review. Now and then one stops and says a few words
to her. Little by little they disappear into the loft in the
rear</i>.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote>

<p><i>The porch of a country church appears at the right in the
foreground. It is brilliantly white, with a roof of black
shingle</i>. Near the entrance is a sort of pillory, at the foot
of which <span class="small-c">KERSTI</span> <i>lies in penitential garb, with the hood pulled
forward to cover her face</i>.</p>

<p><i>A big lake, surrounded by a typical Dalecarlian landscape,
forms the background. At the foot of the open place before the
church is a boat-landing. A point of land projects into the
lake at the right, and there stands the scaffold, consisting
of a simple wooden platform with a block on it. Two soldiers,
fully armed, stand "at ease" by the entrance to the porch, from
within which an organ prelude is heard when the curtain rises</i>.</p>

<p><i>Two large "church-boats" (of the kind used on Lake Siljan in
Dalecarlia) gliding slowly forward from opposite directions,
arrive at the landing simultaneously. The rowers have raised
their oars and appear to be disputing about the right of
landing</i>.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">MATS'S RELATIVES</span> <i>are in the boat at the left</i>; <span class="small-c">KERSTI'S

<p><span class="small-c">KERSTI'S RELATIVES</span>. [<i>In the same way</i>] Look out!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">KERSTI'S RELATIVES</span>. With sixteen, if needs be! Come on!</p>

<p>Mats. "O," indeed! It's the end, while A is the beginning. Between
those two lie many letters, but the last one of all is O. Cry "O"
again&mdash;the last time of all&mdash;so that the little one may hear it. He
will tell the Lord and the Saviour, and ask them to forgive you! No?
Well, kiss his white coffin then&mdash;kiss it where his small feet are
resting&mdash;the small, small feet that never had a chance to tread this
sinful earth! [<span class="small-c">KERSTI</span> <i>kisses the coffin</i>] That's right! Now we'll take
him into the church and play and sing and toll the bells over him&mdash;but
no clergyman can read him into his grave&mdash;because of you! I will speak
the words myself when we get to the grave. We'll plant him in the sod
like a seed in order that he may sprout and grow into a winged blossom.
Some day, perhaps, he will spread his wings and fly to heaven&mdash;lifted
by the wind when the midsummer sun is shining!</p>

know, and he can't stand that kind of thing. [<i>Handing her daughter
a hymn-book</i>] Take this book&mdash;and read where I have put the mark. And

really can't, being as old as I am....</p>

<p><span class="small-c">KERSTI</span>. Do what you feel like, mother. I have found my comforter! I

<p><span class="small-c">KERSTI</span>. No, mother, you must spare yourself.... You have had enough
trouble on my account as it is.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">MOTHER</span>. Then I'll take your word for it, so that the mill-folk won't
have anything to talk about. I take your word for it, so that I can
tell them: "Kersti didn't want it&mdash;it was her own will, and of course
her last will was as good as law to me!" And that's just what it is!</p>

Do you know what can be done by the King, and by no other authority?
Do you know that? All other authorities can pass judgment&mdash;all of them
can do that&mdash;harshly or mercifully; but there is only one that can
grant pardon. That's the King!&mdash;Shall we ask the antking if he will
grant pardon? [<i>He puts his hand to his ear as if to hear better</i>]
Would your Majesty be willing to pardon her&mdash;that is, in regard to the
worst part?... Did you hear what he answered? I thought he said yes.
But I may have been mistaken.... And being the Sheriff, I can't go by
hearsays, but must have everything in writing. Let us ask the ant-king
to write it down. He has plenty of pens&mdash;sharp as needles&mdash;and he has
ink of his own, that burns. If we could only find a piece of paper!
[<i>He pretends to search his pockets, and finally he brings out the
paper he was reading when he entered</i>] Oh, here we are! Look at this!
The King has written it with his own hand. Do you see? C-A-R-L, which
makes Carl. [<i>He raises his cap for a moment in salute</i>] You haven't
seen such big letters since you went to school, Kersti. And look at the
red seal&mdash;that smelled like resin in the woods when the sealing-wax
still was warm. And look at the silken cords, yellow and blue&mdash;and all
these lions and crowns.... That's royal, every bit of it!... Read it

<blockquote>

<p><i>The stage represents the frozen surface of a big lake, the
shores of which form the background. Deep snow covers the ice.
Tall pine branches stuck into the snow serve to mark the tracks
used in crossing the lake</i>.</p>

<p><i>In the centre of the stage, toward the background, a large
rectangular opening has been cut in the ice. A number of small
spruce-trees have been set along the edges of it to warn
against danger</i>.</p>

<p><i>Long-tailed ducks</i> (Heralda glacialis <i>or</i> Clangula glacialis)
<i>are floating on the open water. Now and then one of them
utters its peculiarly melodious cry. (See musical appendix,
Melody No</i>. 19.)</p>

<p><i>A number of short fishing-rods are placed along the edges of
the open water, with their lines out</i>.</p>

<p><i>A gloomy old structure with turrets and battlements appears on
the shore in the background. It is known as the "Castle", but
is in reality a penitentiary</i>.</p>

<p><i>It is about daybreak</i>.</p>

<p><i>The</i> <span class="small-c">FISHERMAN</span> <i>enters from the right dressed in a sheepskin
coat and hauling a sledge on which lies an ice-hook. All the
ducks dive when he comes in sight. He begins to examine his
fishlines</i>.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="small-c">MIDWIFE</span>. [<i>Entering from the left</i>] How dare you fish on Easter Sunday?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">FISHERMAN</span>. I am not fishing&mdash;I'm just looking.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">MIDWIFE</span>. Perhaps you, who are so clever, can also tell a poor, strayed
old woman where she is?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">FISHERMAN</span>. If you give me a light.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">MIDWIFE</span>. If you have flint and steel.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">FISHERMAN</span>. [<i>Handing her two pieces of ice</i>] Here they are.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">MIDWIFE</span>. Ice? Well, water is fire, and fire is water!</p>

<blockquote>

<p><i>She tears off a piece of her cloak to serve as tinder; then,
she strikes the two pieces of ice against each other; hiving
set the tinder on fire in that way, she hands it to the</i>
<span class="small-c">FISHERMAN</span>, <i>who lights his pipe with it</i>.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="small-c">FISHERMAN</span>. Oh, you are that kind? Then I know where I am.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">MIDWIFE</span>. But where am I?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">FISHERMAN</span>. In the middle of Krummedikke's lake, and over there you see
his castle. He was a king who lived long, long ago, and, like Herod, he
caused all male babes to be slain because he was afraid for his crown.
But now his castle holds all the girls who have not been afraid for
theirs.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">MIDWIFE</span>. What are they doing in there?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">FISHERMAN</span>. Spinning flax.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">MIDWIFE</span>. That's the jail, then?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">FISHERMAN</span>. That's what it is.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">MIDWIFE</span>. And the lake?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">FISHERMAN</span>. Oh, it's a good one! There used to be dry land where the
lake is now, and on that piece of land stood a church, and that church
started a feud. It was a question of pews, you see. The mill-folk, who
thought themselves above the rest, wanted to sit next to the altar, but
the Mewlings were the stronger. One Easter Sunday it broke loose, right
in the nave, and blood was shed. The church was profaned so that it
could never be cleansed again. Instead it was closed up and deserted,
and by and by it sank into the earth, and now there are fifty feet of
water above the weathercock on the spire. By this time the lake has
been washing it and washing it these many hundred years, but as long
as mill-folk and Mewlings keep on fighting, the temple will never be
cleansed.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">MIDWIFE</span>. Why are they called Mewlings?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">FISHERMAN</span>. Because they are descended from Krummedikke, who slew the
infants.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">MIDWIFE</span>. And they are still fighting?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">FISHERMAN</span>. Still fighting, and still slaying.... You remember, don't
you, Kersti, the soldier's daughter?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">MIDWIFE</span>. Of course, I do.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">FISHERMAN</span>. She is in the Castle, but to-day she will be out to do her
yearly public penance at the church.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">MIDWIFE</span>. Is that so?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">FISHERMAN</span>. The Mewlings are coming to bring her over, and the mill-folk
are coming to look on.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">MIDWIFE</span>. Do you hear the ice tuning up?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">FISHERMAN</span>. I do.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">MIDWIFE</span>. Does it mean thaw?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">FISHERMAN</span>. Maybe.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">MIDWIFE</span>. Then the ice will begin to break from the shore?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">FISHERMAN</span>. Quite likely. But if the water should rise, the rapids down
there will carry it off.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">MIDWIFE</span>. Are the rapids far from here?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">FISHERMAN</span>. Naw! You can hear the Neck quite plainly. To-day he will be
up betimes, as he is expecting something.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">MIDWIFE</span>. What can he be expecting?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">FISHERMAN</span>. Oh, you know!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">MIDWIFE</span>. No, I don't. Please tell me.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">FISHERMAN</span>. This is what they tell: Every Easter Sunday morning, at
the hour when the Saviour ascended from his grave, the church of
Krummedikke rises out of the lake. And he who gets a look at it has
peace in his soul for the rest of the year.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">MIDWIFE</span>. [<i>Gallops out toward the right</i>] Ad-zee! Ad-zee! Ad-zee!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">FISHERMAN</span>. That was a bad meeting.... [<i>He lands a fish and takes it
from the hook</i>] I got you!</p>

<p><i>The fish slips out of his hand and leaps into the water. The</i>
<span class="small-c">FISHERMAN</span> <i>tries to catch it with his dip-net. Then a whole row
of fish-heads appear above the water</i>.</p></blockquote>

<p style="text-align: center;">FIRST SCENE</p>


<blockquote>

<p><i>The stage shows the first and second stories of a modern
corner home. At the left, the house continues into the wings;
at the right, it faces on a street supposed to be running at
right angle to the footlights</i>.</p>

<p><i>The apartment on the ground floor ends at the corner in a
round room, above which is a balcony belonging to the apartment
on the second floor. A flagstaff is fixed to the balcony</i>.</p>

<p><i>When the shades are raised in the windows of the Round Room, a
statue of a young woman in white marble becomes visible inside,
strongly illumined by sunlight. It is surrounded by palms. The
windows on the left side of the Round Room contain a number of
flower-pots, in which grow blue, white, and red hyacinths</i>.</p>

<p><i>A bedquilt of blue silk and two pillows in white cases are
hung over the railing of the balcony on the second floor. The
windows at the left of the balcony are covered with white
sheets on the inside</i>.</p>

<p><i>A green bench stands on the sidewalk in front of the house.
The right corner of the foreground is occupied by a drinking
fountain; the corner at the left, by an advertising column</i>.</p>

<p><i>The main entrance to the house is near the left wing. Through
the open doorway appears the foot of the stairway, with
steps of white marble and a banister of mahogany with brass
trimmings. On the sidewalk, flanking the entrance, stand two
laurel-trees in wooden tubs</i>.</p>

<p><i>At the left of the entrance, there is a window on the ground
floor, with a window-mirror outside</i>.</p>

<p><i>It is a bright Sunday morning</i>.</p>

<p><i>When the curtain rises, the bells of several churches are
heard ringing in the distance</i>.</p>

<p><i>The doors of the entrance are wide open, and on the lowest
step of the stairway stands the</i> <span class="small-c">DARK LADY</span>. <i>She does not make
the slightest movement</i>.</p>

<p><i>The</i> <span class="small-c">JANITRESS</span> <i>is sweeping the hallway. Then she polishes the
brass knobs on the doors. Finally she waters the laurel-trees</i>.</p>

<p><i>Near the advertising column</i>, <span class="small-c">OLD HUMMEL</span> <i>is reading his
paper, seated in an invalid's chair on wheels. His hair and
beard are white, and he wears spectacles</i>.</p>

<p><i>The</i> <span class="small-c">MILKMAID</span> <i>enters from the side street, carrying
milk-bottles in a crate of wire-work. She wears a light dress,
brown shoes, black stockings, and a white cap</i>.</p>

<p><i>She takes off her cap and hangs it on the fountain; wipes the
perspiration from her forehead; drinks out of the cup; washes
her hands in the basin, and arranges her hair, using the water
in the basin as a mirror</i>.</p>

<p><i>A steamship-bell is heard outside. Then the silence is broken
fitfully by a few bass notes from the organ in the nearest
church</i>.</p>

<p><i>When silence reigns again, and the</i> <span class="small-c">MILKMAID</span> <i>has finished
her toilet, the</i> <span class="small-c">STUDENT</span> <i>enters from the left, unshaved and
showing plainly that he has spent a sleepless night. He goes
straight to the fountain. A pause ensues</i>.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="small-c">STUDENT</span>. Can I have the cup?</p>

<blockquote>

<p><i>The</i> <span class="small-c">MILKMAID</span> <i>draws back with the cup</i>.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="small-c">STUDENT</span>. Are you not almost done?</p>

<blockquote>

<p><i>The</i> <span class="small-c">MILKMAID</span> <i>stares at him with horror</i>.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="small-c">HUMMEL</span>. [<i>To himself</i>] With whom is he talking? I don't see anybody.
Wonder if he's crazy?</p>

<blockquote>

<p>[<i>He continues to look at them with evident surprise</i>.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="small-c">STUDENT</span>. Why do you stare at me? Do I look so terrible&mdash;It is true
that I haven't slept at all, and I suppose you think I have been making
a night of it....</p>

<blockquote>

<p><i>The</i> <span class="small-c">MILKMAID</span> <i>remains as before</i>.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="small-c">STUDENT</span>. You think I have been drinking, do you? Do I smell of liquor?</p>

<blockquote>

<p><i>The</i> <span class="small-c">MILKMAID</span> <i>remains as before</i>.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="small-c">STUDENT</span>. I haven't shaved, of course.... Oh, give me a drink of water,
girl. I have earned it. [<i>Pause</i>] Well? Must I then tell you myself
that I have spent the night dressing wounds and nursing the injured?
You see, I was present when that house collapsed last night.... Now you
know all about it.</p>

<blockquote>

<p><i>The</i> <span class="small-c">MILKMAID</span> <i>rinses the cup, fills it with water, and hands
it to him</i>.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="small-c">STUDENT</span>. Thanks!</p>

<blockquote>

<p><i>The</i> Milkmaid <i>stands immovable</i>.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="small-c">STUDENT</span>. [<i>Hesitatingly</i>] Would you do me a favour? [<i>Pause</i>] My eyes
are inflamed, as you can see, and my hands have touched wounds and
corpses. To touch my eyes with them would be dangerous.... Will you
take my handkerchief, which is clean, dip it in the fresh water, and
bathe my poor eyes with it?&mdash;Will you do that?&mdash;Won't you play the good
Samaritan?</p>

<blockquote>

<p><i>The</i> <span class="small-c">MILKMAID</span> <i>hesitates at first, but does finally what he
has asked</i>.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="small-c">STUDENT</span>. Thank you! [<i>He takes out his purse</i>.</p>

<blockquote>

<p><i>The</i> <span class="small-c">MILKMAID</span> <i>makes a deprecatory gesture</i>.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="small-c">STUDENT</span>. Pardon my absent-mindedness. I am not awake, you see....</p>

<blockquote>

<p><i>The</i> <span class="small-c">MILKMAID</span> <i>disappears</i>.</p></blockquote>

<p>Hummel. [<i>To the</i> <span class="small-c">STUDENT</span>] Excuse a stranger, but I heard you mention
last night's accident.... I was just reading about it in the paper....</p>

<p><span class="small-c">STUDENT</span>. Is it already in the papers?</p>

<p>HUMMEL. All about it. Even your portrait. They are sorry, though, that
they have not been able to learn the name of the young student who did
such splendid work....</p>

<p><span class="small-c">STUDENT</span>. [<i>Glancing at the paper</i>] Oh, is that me? Well!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">HUMMEL</span>. Whom were you talking to a while ago?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">STUDENT</span>. Didn't you see? [<i>Pause</i>.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">HUMMEL</span>. Would it be impertinent&mdash;to ask&mdash;your estimable name?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">STUDENT</span>. What does it matter? I don't care for publicity. Blame is
always mixed into any praise you may get. The art of belittling is so
highly developed. And besides, I ask no reward....</p>

<p><span class="small-c">HUMMEL</span>. Wealthy, I suppose?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">STUDENT</span>. Not at all&mdash;on the contrary&mdash;poor as a durmouse!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">HUMMEL</span>. Look here.... It seems to me as if I recognised your voice.
When I was young, I had a friend who always said "dur" instead of
door. Until now he was the one person I had ever heard using that
pronunciation. You are the only other one.... Could you possibly be a
relative of the late Mr. Arkenholtz, the merchant?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">STUDENT</span>. He was my father.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">HUMMEL</span>. Wonderful are the ways of life.... I have seen you when you
were a small child, under very trying circumstances....</p>

<p><span class="small-c">STUDENT</span>. Yes, I have been told that I was born just after my father had
gone bankrupt.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">HUMMEL</span>. So you were.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">STUDENT</span>. May I ask your name?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">HUMMEL</span>. I am Mr. Hummel.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">STUDENT</span>. You are? Then I remember....</p>

<p><span class="small-c">HUMMEL</span>. Have you often heard my name mentioned at home?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">STUDENT</span>. I have.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">HUMMEL</span>. And not in a pleasant way, I suppose?</p>

<blockquote>

<p><i>The</i> <span class="small-c">STUDENT</span> <i>remains silent</i>.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="small-c">HUMMEL</span>. That's what I expected.&mdash;You were told, I suppose, that I had
ruined your father?&mdash;All who are ruined by ill-advised speculations
think themselves ruined by those whom they couldn't fool. [<i>Pause</i>]
The fact of it is, however, that your father robbed me of seventeen
thousand crowns, which represented all my savings at that time.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">STUDENT</span>. It is queer how the same story can be told in quite different
ways.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">HUMMEL</span>. You don't think that I am telling the truth?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">STUDENT</span>. How can I tell what to think? My father was not in the habit
of lying.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">HUMMEL</span>. No, that's right, a father never lies.... But I am also a
father, and for that reason....</p>

<p><span class="small-c">STUDENT</span>. What are you aiming at?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">HUMMEL</span>. I saved your father from misery, and he repaid me with the
ruthless hatred that is born out of obligation.... He taught his family
to speak ill of me.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">STUDENT</span>. Perhaps you made him ungrateful by poisoning your assistance
with needless humiliation.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">HUMMEL</span>. All assistance is humiliating, sir.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">STUDENT</span>. And what do you ask of me now?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">HUMMEL</span>. Not the money back. But if you will render me a small service
now and then, I shall consider myself well paid. I am a cripple, as you
see. Some people say it is my own fault. Others lay it to my parents.
I prefer to blame life itself, with its snares. To escape one of these
snares is to walk headlong into another. As it is, I cannot climb
stairways or ring door-bells, and for that reason I ask you: will you
help me a little?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">STUDENT</span>. What can I do for you?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">HUMMEL</span>. Give my chair a push, to begin with, so that I can read the
bills on that column. I wish to see what they are playing to-night.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">STUDENT</span>. [<i>Pushing the chair as directed</i>] Have you no attendant?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">HUMMEL</span>. Yes, but he is doing an errand. He'll be back soon. Are you a
medical student?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">STUDENT</span>. No, I am studying philology, but I don't know what profession
to choose....</p>

<p><span class="small-c">HUMMEL</span>. Well, well! Are you good at mathematics?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">STUDENT</span>. Reasonably so.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">HUMMEL</span>. That's good! Would you care to accept a position?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">STUDENT</span>. Yes, why not?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">HUMMEL</span>. Fine! [<i>Studying the playbills</i>] They are playing "The Valkyr"
at the matinee.... Then the Colonel will be there with his daughter,
and as he always has the end seat in the sixth row, I'll put you next
to him.... Will you please go over to that telephone kiosk and order a
ticket for seat eighty-two, in the sixth row?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">STUDENT</span>. Must I go to the opera in the middle of the day?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">HUMMEL</span>. Yes. Obey me, and you'll prosper. I wish to see you happy,
rich, and honoured. Your début last night in the part of the brave
rescuer will have made you famous by to-morrow, and then your name
will be worth a great deal.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">STUDENT</span>. [<i>On his way out to telephone</i>] What a ludicrous adventure!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">HUMMEL</span>. Are you a sportsman?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">STUDENT</span>. Yes, that has been my misfortune.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">HUMMEL</span>. Then we'll turn it into good fortune.&mdash;Go and telephone now.</p>

<blockquote>

<p><i>The</i> <span class="small-c">STUDENT</span> <i>goes out</i>. <span class="small-c">HUMMEL</span> <i>begins to read his paper
again. In the meantime the</i> <span class="small-c">DARK LADY</span> <i>has come out on the
sidewalk and stands talking to the</i> <span class="small-c">JANITRESS</span>. <span class="small-c">HUMMEL</span> <i>is
taking in their conversation, of which, however, nothing is
audible to the public</i>. <i>After a while the</i> <span class="small-c">STUDENT</span> <i>returns</i>.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="small-c">HUMMEL</span>. Ready?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">STUDENT</span>. It's done.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">HUMMEL</span>. Have you noticed this house?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">STUDENT</span>. Yes, I have been watching it.... I happened to pass by
yesterday, when the sun was making every window-pane glitter.... And
thinking of all the beauty and luxury that must be found within, I
said to my companion: "Wouldn't it be nice to have an apartment on the
fifth floor, a beautiful young wife, two pretty little children, and an
income of twenty thousand crowns?"...</p>

<p><span class="small-c">HUMMEL</span>. So you said that? Did you really? Well, well! I am very fond of
this house, too....</p>

<p><span class="small-c">STUDENT</span>. Do you speculate in houses?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">HUMMEL</span>. Mm-yah! But not in the way you mean.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">STUDENT</span>. Do you know the people who live here?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">HUMMEL</span>. All of them. A man of my age knows everybody, including
their parents and grandparents, and in some manner he always finds
himself related to every one else. I am just eighty&mdash;but nobody knows
<i>me</i>&mdash;not through and through. I am very much interested in human
destinies.</p>

<blockquote>

<p><i>At that moment the shades are raised in the Round Room on the
ground floor, and the</i> <span class="small-c">COLONEL</span> <i>becomes visible, dressed in
civilian clothes. He goes to one of the windows to study the
thermometer outside. Then he turns back into the room and stops
in front of the marble statue</i>.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="small-c">HUMMEL</span>. There's the Colonel now, who will sit next to you at the opera
this afternoon.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">STUDENT</span>. Is <i>he</i>&mdash;the Colonel? I don't understand this at all, but it's
like a fairy-tale.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">HUMMEL</span>. All my life has been like a collection of fairy-tales, my dear
sir. Although the tales read differently, they are all strung on a
common thread, and the dominant theme recurs constantly.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">STUDENT</span>. Whom does that statue represent?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">HUMMEL</span>. His wife, of course.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">STUDENT</span>. Was she very lovely?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">HUMMEL</span>. Mm-yah&mdash;well....</p>

<p><span class="small-c">STUDENT</span>. Speak out.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">HUMMEL</span>. Oh, we can't form any judgment about people, my dear boy. And
if I told you that she left him, that he beat her, that she returned to
him, that she married him a second time, and that she is living there
now in the shape of a mummy, worshipping her own statue&mdash;then you would
think me crazy.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">STUDENT</span>. I don't understand at all.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">HUMMEL</span>. I didn't expect you would. Then there is the window with the
hyacinths. That's where his daughter lives? She is out for a ride now,
but she will be home in a few moments.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">STUDENT</span>. And who is the dark lady talking to the janitress?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">HUMMEL</span>. The answer is rather complicated, but it is connected with the
dead man on the second floor, where you see the white sheets.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">STUDENT</span>. Who was he?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">HUMMEL</span>. A human being like you or me, but the most conspicuous thing
about him was his vanity.... If you were born on a Sunday, you might
soon see him come down the stairway and go out on the sidewalk to make
sure that the flag of the consulate is half-masted. You see, he was
a consul, and he revelled in coronets and lions and plumed hats and
coloured ribbons.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">STUDENT</span>. You spoke of being born on a Sunday.... So was I, I understand.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">HUMMEL</span>. No! Really?... Oh, I should have known.... The colour of your eyes
shows it.... Then you can see what other people can't. Have you noticed
anything of that kind?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">STUDENT</span>. Of course, I can't tell what other people see or don't see,
but at times.... Oh, such things you don't talk of!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">HUMMEL</span>. I was sure of it! And you can talk to me, because I&mdash;I
understand&mdash;things of that kind....</p>

<p><span class="small-c">STUDENT</span>. Yesterday, for instance.... I was drawn to that little side
street where the house fell down afterward.... When I got there, I
stopped in front of the house, which I had never seen before....
Then I noticed a crack in the wall.... I could hear the floor beams
snapping.... I rushed forward and picked up a child that was walking
in front of the house at the time.... In another moment the house came
tumbling down.... I was saved, but in my arms, which I thought held
the child, there was nothing at all....</p>

<p><span class="small-c">HUMMEL</span>. Well, I must say!... Much as I have heard.... Please tell me
one thing: what made you act as you did by the fountain a while ago?
Why were you talking to yourself?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">STUDENT</span>. Didn't you see the Milkmaid to whom I was talking?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">HUMMEL</span>. [<i>Horrified</i>] A milkmaid?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">STUDENT</span>. Yes, the girl who handed me the cup.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">HUMMEL</span>. Oh, that's what it was.... Well, I haven't that kind of sight, but
there are other things....</p>

<blockquote>

<p><i>A white-haired old woman is seen at the window beside the
entrance, looking into the window-mirror</i>.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="small-c">HUMMEL</span>. Look at that old woman in the window. Do you see her?&mdash;Well,
she was my fiancée once upon a time, sixty years ago.... I was twenty
at that time.... Never mind, she does not recognise me. We see each
other every day, and I hardly notice her&mdash;although once we vowed to
love each other eternally.... Eternally!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">STUDENT</span>. How senseless you were in those days! We don't talk to our
girls like that.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">HUMMEL</span>. Forgive us, young man! We didn't know better.&mdash;Can you see
that she was young and pretty once?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">STUDENT</span>. It doesn't show.... Oh, yes, she has a beautiful way of
looking at things, although I can't see her eyes clearly.</p>

<blockquote>

<p><i>The</i> <span class="small-c">JANITRESS</span> <i>comes out with a basket on her arm and begins
to cover the sidewalk with chopped hemlock branches, as is
usual in Sweden when a funeral is to be held</i>.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="small-c">HUMMEL</span>. And the Janitress&mdash;hm! That Dark Lady is her daughter and the
dead man's, and that's why her husband was made janitor.... But the
Dark Lady has a lover, who is a dandy with great expectations. He is
now getting a divorce from his present wife, who is giving him an
apartment-house to get rid of him. This elegant lover is the son-in-law
of the dead man, and you can see his bedclothes being aired on the
balcony up there.... That's a bit complicated, I should say!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">STUDENT</span>. Yes, it's fearfully complicated.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">HUMMEL</span>. It certainly is, inside and outside, no matter how simple it
may look.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">STUDENT</span>. But who was the dead man?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">HUMMEL</span>. So you asked me a while ago, and I answered you. If you could
look around the corner, where the servants' entrance is, you would see
a lot of poor people whom he used to help&mdash;when he was in the mood....</p>

<p><span class="small-c">STUDENT</span>. He was a kindly man, then?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">HUMMEL</span>. Yes&mdash;at times.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">STUDENT</span>. Not always?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">HUMMEL</span>. No-o.... People are like that!&mdash;Will you please move the chair
a little, so that I get into the sunlight? I am always cold. You see,
the blood congeals when you can't move about.... Death isn't far away
from me, I know, but I have a few things to do before it comes.... Just
take hold of my hand and feel how cold I am.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">STUDENT</span>. [<i>Taking his hand</i>] I should say so!</p>

<blockquote>

<p>[<i>He shrinks back</i>.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="small-c">HUMMEL</span>. Don't leave me! I am tired now, and lonely, but I haven't
always been like this, you know. I have an endlessly long life back
of&mdash;enormously long.... I have made people unhappy, and other people
have made me unhappy, and one thing has to be put against the other,
but before I die, I wish to see you happy.... Our destinies have become
intertwined, thanks to your father&mdash;and many other things....</p>

<p><span class="small-c">STUDENT</span>. Let go my hand! You are taking all my strength! You are
freezing me! What do you want of me?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">HUMMEL</span>. Patience, and you'll see, and understand.... There comes the
Young Lady now....</p>

<p><span class="small-c">STUDENT</span>. The Colonel's daughter?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">HUMMEL</span>. His daughter&mdash;yes! Look at her!&mdash;Did you ever see such a
masterpiece?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">STUDENT</span>. She resembles the marble statue in there.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">HUMMEL</span>. It's her mother.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">STUDENT</span>. You are right.... Never did I see such a woman of woman
born!&mdash;Happy the man who may lead her to the altar and to his home!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">HUMMEL</span>. You see it, then? Her beauty is not discovered by everybody....
Then it is written in the book of life!</p>

<blockquote>

<p><i>The</i> <span class="small-c">YOUNG LADY</span> <i>enters from the left, wearing a close-fitting
English riding-suit. Without looking at any one, she walks

The</i> <span class="small-c">STUDENT</span> <i>covers his eyes with his hand</i>.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="small-c">HUMMEL</span>. Are you crying?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">STUDENT</span>. Can you meet what is hopeless with anything but despair?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">HUMMEL</span>. I have the power of opening doors and hearts, if I can only
find an arm to do my will.... Serve me, and you shall also have
power....</p>

<p><span class="small-c">STUDENT</span>. Is it to be a bargain? Do you want me to sell my soul?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">HUMMEL</span>. Don't sell anything!... You see, all my life I have been used
to <i>take</i>. Now I have a craving to give&mdash;to give! But no one will
accept.... I am rich, very rich, but have no heirs except a scamp who
is tormenting the life out of me.... Become my son! Inherit me while
I am still alive! Enjoy life, and let me look on&mdash;from a distance, at
least!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">STUDENT</span>. What am I to do?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">HUMMEL</span>. Go and hear "The Valkyr" first of all.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">STUDENT</span>. That's settled&mdash;but what more?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">HUMMEL</span>. This evening you shall be in the Round Room.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">STUDENT</span>. How am I to get there?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">HUMMEL</span>. Through "The Valkyr."</p>

<p><span class="small-c">STUDENT</span>. Why have you picked me to be your instrument? Did you know me
before?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">HUMMEL</span>. Of course, I did! I have had my eyes on you for a long
time.... Look at the balcony now, where the Maid is raising the flag
at half-mast in honour of the consul.... And then she turns the
bedclothes.... Do you notice that blue quilt? It was made to cover
two, and now it is only covering one.... [<i>The</i> YOUNG LADY <i>appears
at her window, having changed dress in the meantime; she waters the
hyacinths</i>] There is my little girl now. Look at her&mdash;look! She is
talking to her flowers, and she herself looks like a blue hyacinth.
She slakes their thirst&mdash;with pure water only&mdash;and they transform the
water into colour and fragrance.... There comes the Colonel with the
newspaper! He shows her the story about the house that fell down&mdash;and
he points at your portrait! She is not indifferent&mdash;she reads of your
deeds.... It's clouding up, I think.... I wonder if it's going to
rain? Then I shall be in a nice fix, unless Johansson comes back soon
[<i>The sun has disappeared, and now the stage is growing darker; the
white-haired old woman closes her window</i>] Now my fiancée is closing
her window.... She is seventy-nine&mdash;and the only mirror she uses is
the window-mirror, because there she sees not herself, but the world
around her&mdash;and she sees it from two sides&mdash;but it has not occurred to
her that she can be seen by the world, too.... A handsome old lady,
after all....</p>

<blockquote>

<p><i>Now the</i> <span class="small-c">GHOST</span>, <i>wrapped in winding sheets, comes out of the
entrance</i>.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="small-c">STUDENT</span>. Good God, what is that I see?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">HUMMEL</span>. What <i>do</i> you see?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">STUDENT</span>. Don't <i>you</i> see?... There, at the entrance.... The dead man?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">HUMMEL</span>. I see nothing at all, but that was what I expected. Tell me....</p>

<p><span class="small-c">STUDENT</span>. He comes out in the street.... [<i>Pause</i>] Now he turns his head
to look at the flag.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">HUMMEL</span>. What did I tell you? And you may be sure that he will count the
wreaths and study the visiting-cards attached to them.... And I pity
anybody that is missing!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">STUDENT</span>. Now he goes around the corner....</p>

<p><span class="small-c">HUMMEL</span>. He wants to count the poor at the other entrance.... The poor are
so decorative, you know.... "Followed by the blessings of many".... But
he won't get any blessing from me!&mdash;Between us, he was a big rascal!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">STUDENT</span>. But charitable....</p>

<p><span class="small-c">HUMMEL</span>. A charitable rascal, who always had in mind the splendid
funeral he expected to get.... When he knew that his end was near, he
cheated the state out of fifty thousand crowns.... And now his daughter
goes about with ... another woman's husband, and wonders what is in his
will.... Yes, the rascal can hear every word we say, and he is welcome
to it!&mdash;There comes Johansson now.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">HUMMEL</span>. Not at home, you say? Oh, you are no good!&mdash;Any telegram?&mdash;Not
a thing.... Go on!&mdash;Six o'clock to-night?&mdash;That's fine!&mdash;An extra, you
say?&mdash;With his full name?&mdash;Arkenholtz, a student, yes.... Born....
Parents.... That's splendid! I think it's beginning to rain.... What
did he say?&mdash;Is that so?&mdash;He won't?&mdash;Well, then he must!&mdash;Here comes
the Dandy.... Push me around the corner, Johansson, so I can hear what
the poor people have to say.... [<i>To the</i> <span class="small-c">STUDENT</span>] And you had better

<p><span class="small-c">DARK LADY</span>. But I can't wait!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">DANDY</span>. Is that so? Then you'll have to go to the country.</p>

you not to forget that other thing.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">STUDENT</span>. [<i>Dragging his words</i>] Look here.... Tell me, please.... Who
<i>is</i> your master?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">JOHANSSON</span>. Oh, he's so many things, and he has been everything....</p>

<p><span class="small-c">STUDENT</span>. Is he in his right mind?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">JOHANSSON</span>. Who can tell?&mdash;All his life he has been looking for one born
on Sunday, he says&mdash;which does not mean that it must be true....</p>

<p><span class="small-c">STUDENT</span>. What is he after? Is he a miser?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">JOHANSSON</span>. He wants to rule.... The whole day long he travels about in
his chair like the god of thunder himself He looks at houses, tears
them down, opens up new streets, fills the squares with buildings....
At the same time he breaks into houses, sneaks through open windows,
plays havoc with human destinies, kills his enemies, and refuses to
forgive anything.... Can you imagine that a cripple like him has been a
Don Juan&mdash;but one who has always lost the women he loved?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">STUDENT</span>. How can you make those things go together?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">JOHANSSON</span>. He is so full of guile that he can make the women leave
him when he is tired of them.... Just now he is like a horse thief
practising at a slave-market.... He steals human beings, and in all
sorts of ways.... He has literally stolen me out of the hands of the
law.... Hm.... yes.... I had been guilty of a slip. And no one but he
knew of it. Instead of putting me in jail, he made a slave of me. All I
get for my slavery is the food I eat, which might be better at that....</p>

<p><span class="small-c">STUDENT</span>. And what does he wish to do in this house here?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">JOHANSSON</span>. No, I don't want to tell! It's too complicated....</p>

<p><span class="small-c">STUDENT</span>. I think I'll run away from the whole story....</p>

<blockquote>

<p><i>The</i> <span class="small-c">YOUNG LADY</span> <i>drops a bracelet out of the window so that it
falls on the sidewalk</i>.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="small-c">JOHANSSON</span>. Did you see the Young Lady drop her bracelet out of the
window?</p>

<blockquote>

<p><i>Without haste, the</i> <span class="small-c">STUDENT</span> <i>picks up the bracelet and hands
it to the</i> <span class="small-c">YOUNG LADY</span>, <i>who thanks him rather stiffly; then he
returns to</i> <span class="small-c">JOHANSSON</span>.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="small-c">JOHANSSON</span>. So you want to run away? That is more easily said than done
when <i>he</i> has got you in his net.... And he fears nothing between heaven
and earth except one thing or one person rather....</p>

<p><span class="small-c">STUDENT</span>. Wait&mdash;I think I know!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">JOHANSSON</span>. How could you?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">STUDENT</span>. I can guess! Is it not&mdash;a little milkmaid that he fears?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">JOHANSSON</span>. He turns his head away whenever he meets a milk wagon....
And at times he talks in his sleep.... He must have been in Hamburg at
one time, I think....</p>

<p><span class="small-c">STUDENT</span>. Is this man to be trusted?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">JOHANSSON</span>. You may trust him&mdash;to do anything!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">STUDENT</span>. What is he doing around the corner now?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">JOHANSSON</span>. Watching the poor dropping a word here and a word there....
loosening a stone at a time ... until the whole house comes tumbling
down, metaphorically speaking.... You see, I am an educated man, and I used
to be a book dealer.... Are you going now?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">STUDENT</span>. I find it hard to be ungrateful.... Once upon a time he saved
my father, and now he asks a small service in return....</p>

<p><span class="small-c">JOHANSSON</span>. What is it?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">STUDENT</span>. To go and see "The Valkyr"....</p>

<p><span class="small-c">JOHANSSON</span>. That's beyond me.... But he is always up to new tricks....
Look at him now, talking to the police-man! He is always thick with the
police. He uses them. He snares them in their own interests. He ties
their hands by arousing their expectations with false promises&mdash;while
all the time he is pumping them.... You'll see that he is received in
the Round Room before the day is over!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">STUDENT</span>. What does he want there? What has he to do with the Colonel?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">JOHANSSON</span>. I think I can guess, but know nothing with certainty. But
you'll see for yourself when you get there!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">STUDENT</span>. I'll never get there.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">JOHANSSON</span>. That depends on yourself!&mdash;Go to "The Valkyr."</p>

<p><span class="small-c">STUDENT</span>. Is that the road?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">JOHANSSON</span>. Yes, if he has said so&mdash;Look at him there&mdash;look at him in
his war chariot, drawn in triumph by the Beggars, who get nothing for
their pains but a hint of a great treat to be had at his funeral.</p>

occasion I brought a drowned person back to life.... That happened in

<p style="text-align: center;">SECOND SCENE</p>


<blockquote>

<p><i>In the Round Room. An oven of white, glazed bricks occupies
the centre of the background. The mantelpiece is covered by a
large mirror. An ornamental clock and candelabra stand on the
mantelshelf</i>.</p>

<p><i>At the right of the mantelpiece is a door leading into a
hallway, back of which may be seen a room papered in green,
with mahogany furniture. The</i> <span class="small-c">COLONEL</span> <i>is seated at a
writing-desk, so that only his back is visible to the public</i>.</p>

<p><i>The statue stands at the left, surrounded by palms and with
draperies arranged so that it can be hidden entirely</i>.</p>

<p><i>A door at the left of the mantelpiece opens on the Hyacinth
Room, where the</i> <span class="small-c">YOUNG LADY</span> <i>is seen reading a book</i>.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">BENGTSSON</span>, <i>the valet, enters from the hallway, dressed in
livery. He is followed by</i> <span class="small-c">JOHANSSON</span> <i>in evening dress with
white tie</i>.</p></blockquote>


<p><span class="small-c">BENGTSSON</span>. Now you'll have to do the waiting, Johansson, while I take
the overclothes. Do you know how to do it?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">JOHANSSON</span>. Although I am pushing a war chariot in the daytime, as you
know, I wait in private houses at night, and I have always dreamt of
getting into this place.... Queer sort of people, hm?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">BENGTSSON</span>. Yes, a little out of the ordinary, one might say.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">JOHANSSON</span>. Is it a musicale, or what is it?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">BENGTSSON</span>. The usual spook supper, as we call it. They drink tea and
don't say a word, or else the Colonel does all the talking. And then
they munch their biscuits, all at the same time, so that it sounds like
the gnawing of a lot of rats in an attic.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">JOHANSSON</span>. Why do you call it a spook supper?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">BENGTSSON</span>. Because they look like spooks.... And they have kept this
up for twenty years&mdash;always the same people, saying the same things or
keeping silent entirely, lest they be put to shame.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">JOHANSSON</span>. Is there not a lady in the house, too?</p>

<p>BENGTSSON. Yes, but she is a little cracked. She sits all the time in a
closet, because her eyes can't bear the light. [<i>He points at a papered
door</i>] She is in there now.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">JOHANSSON</span>. In there, you say?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">BENGTSSON</span>. I told you they were a little out of the ordinary....</p>

<p><span class="small-c">JOHANSSON</span>. How does she look?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">BENGTSSON</span>. Like a mummy.... Would you care to look at her? [<i>He opens
the papered door</i>] There she is now!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">JOHANSSON</span>. Mercy!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">MUMMY</span>. [<i>Talking baby talk</i>] Why does he open the door? Haven't I told
him to keep it closed?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">BENGTSSON</span>. [<i>In the same way</i>] Ta-ta-ta-ta! Polly must be nice now.
Then she'll get something good. Pretty polly!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">MUMMY</span>. [<i>Imitating a parrot</i>] Pretty polly! Are you there, Jacob?
Currrrr!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">BENGTSSON</span>. She thinks herself a parrot, and maybe she's right [<i>To the</i>
<span class="small-c">MUMMY</span>] Whistle for us, Polly.</p>

<blockquote>

<p><i>The</i> <span class="small-c">MUMMY</span> <i>whistles</i>.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="small-c">JOHANSSON</span>. Much I have seen, but never the like of it!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">BENGTSSON</span>. Well, you see, a house gets mouldy when it grows old, and
when people are too much together, tormenting each other all the time,
they lose their reason. The lady of this house.... Shut up, Polly!...
That mummy has been living here forty years&mdash;with the same husband, the
same furniture, the same relatives, the same friends.... [<i>He closes
the papered door</i>] And the happenings this house has witnessed! Well,
it's beyond me.... Look at that statue. That's the selfsame lady in her
youth.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">JOHANSSON</span>. Good Lord! Can that be the Mummy?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">BENGTSSON</span>. Yes, it's enough to make you weep!&mdash;And somehow, carried
away by her own imagination, perhaps, she has developed some of the
traits of the talkative parrot.... She can't stand cripples or sick
people, for instance.... She can't bear the sight of her own daughter,
because she is sick....</p>

<p><span class="small-c">JOHANSSON</span>. Is the Young Lady sick?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">BENGTSSON</span>. Don't you know that?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">JOHANSSON</span>. No.&mdash;And the Colonel&mdash;who is he?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">BENGTSSON</span>. That remains to be seen!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">JOHANSSON</span>. [<i>Looking at the statue</i>] It's horrible to think that....
How old is she now?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">BENGTSSON</span>. Nobody knows. But at thirty-five she is said to have looked
like nineteen, and that's the age she gave to the Colonel.... In this
house.... Do you know what that Japanese screen by the couch is used
for? They call it the Death Screen, and it is placed in front of the
bed when somebody is dying, just as they do in hospitals....</p>

<p><span class="small-c">JOHANSSON</span>. This must be an awful house! And the Student was longing for
it as for paradise....</p>

<p><span class="small-c">BENGTSSON</span>. What student? Oh, I know! The young chap who is coming here
to-night.... The Colonel and the Young Lady met him at the opera and took
a great fancy to him at once.... Hm!... But now it's my turn to ask
questions. Who's your master? The man in the invalid's chair?...</p>

<p><span class="small-c">JOHANSSON</span>. Well, well! Is he coming here, too?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">BENGTSSON</span>. He has not been invited.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">JOHANSSON</span>. He'll come without invitation&mdash;if necessary.</p>

<blockquote>

<p><span class="small-c">OLD HUMMEL</span> <i>appears in the hallway, dressed in frock coat and
high hat. He uses crutches, but moves without a noise, so that
he is able to listen to the two servants.</i></p></blockquote>

<p><span class="small-c">BENGTSSON</span>. He's a sly old guy, isn't he?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">JOHANSSON</span>. Yes, he's a good one!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">BENGTSSON</span>. He looks like the very devil.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">JOHANSSON</span>. He's a regular wizard, I think because he can pass through
locked doors....</p>

<p><span class="small-c">HUMMEL</span>. [<i>Comes forward and pinches the ear of</i> <span class="small-c">JOHANSSON</span>] Look out,
you scoundrel! [<i>To</i> <span class="small-c">BENGTSSON</span>] Tell the Colonel I am here.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">BENGTSSON</span>. We expect company....</p>

<p><span class="small-c">HUMMEL</span>. I know, but my visit is as good as expected, too, although not
exactly desired, perhaps....</p>

<p><span class="small-c">BENGTSSON</span>. I see! What's the name? Mr. Hummel?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">HUMMEL</span>. That's right.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">BENGTSSON</span> <i>crosses the hallway to the Green Room, the door of

<p><span class="small-c">JOHANSSON</span> <i>hesitates</i>.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">HUMMEL</span>. Vanish, I say!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">MUMMY</span>. [<i>In the closet</i>] Prrretty Polly!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">HUMMEL</span>. [<i>Startled</i>] What was that? Is there a parrot in the room? I
don't see it!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">MUMMY</span>. Are you there, Jacob?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">HUMMEL</span>. The place is haunted!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">MUMMY</span>. Jacob!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">HUMMEL</span>. Now I am scared!... So that's the kind of secrets they have
been keeping in this house! [<i>He stops in front of a picture with his
back turned to the closet</i>] And that's he.... He!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">MUMMY</span>. [<i>Comes out of the closet and pulls the wig of</i> <span class="small-c">HUMMEL</span>] Currrrr!
Is that Currrrr?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">HUMMEL</span>. [<i>Almost lifted off his feet by fright</i>] Good Lord in
heaven!... Who are you?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">MUMMY</span>. [<i>Speaking in a normal voice</i>] Is that you, Jacob?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">HUMMEL</span>. Yes, my name is Jacob....</p>

<p><span class="small-c">MUMMY</span>. [<i>Deeply moved</i>] And my name is Amelia!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">HUMMEL</span>. Oh, no, no, no!&mdash;Merciful heavens!...</p>

<p><span class="small-c">MUMMY</span>. How I look! That's right!&mdash;And <i>have</i> looked like that!
[<i>Pointing to the statue</i>] Life is a pleasant thing, is it not?... I
live mostly in the closet, both in order to see nothing and not to be
seen.... But, Jacob, what do you want here?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">HUMMEL</span>. My child our child....</p>

<p><span class="small-c">MUMMY</span>. There she sits.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">HUMMEL</span>. Where?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">MUMMY</span>. There&mdash;in the Hyacinth Room.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">HUMMEL</span>. [<i>Looking at the</i> <span class="small-c">YOUNG LADY</span>] Yes, that is she! [<i>Pause</i>] And
what does her father say.... I mean the Colonel.... your husband?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">MUMMY</span>. Once, when I was angry with him, I told him everything....</p>

<p><span class="small-c">HUMMEL</span>. And?...</p>

<p><span class="small-c">MUMMY</span>. He didn't believe me. All he said was: "That's what all women
say when they wish to kill their husbands."&mdash;It is a dreadful crime,
nevertheless. His whole life has been turned into a lie&mdash;his family
tree, too. Sometimes I take a look in the peerage, and then I say to
myself: "Here she is going about with a false birth certificate, just
like any runaway servant-girl, and for such things people are sent to
the reformatory."</p>

<p><span class="small-c">HUMMEL</span>. Well, it's quite common. I think I recall a certain
incorrectness in regard to the date of your own birth.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">MUMMY</span>. It was my mother who started that.... I was not to blame for
it.... And it was you, after all, who had the greater share in our
guilt....</p>

<p><span class="small-c">HUMMEL</span>. No, what wrong we did was provoked by your husband when he took
my fiancée away from me! I was born a man who cannot forgive until he
has punished. To punish has always seemed an imperative duty to me&mdash;and
so it seems still!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">MUMMY</span>. What are you looking for in this house? What do you want? How
did you get in?&mdash;Does it concern my daughter? If you touch her, you
must die!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">HUMMEL</span>. I mean well by her!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">MUMMY</span>. And you have to spare her father!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">HUMMEL</span>. No!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">MUMMY</span>. Then you must die ... in this very room ... back of that
screen....</p>

<p><span class="small-c">HUMMEL</span>. Perhaps.... but I can't let go when I have got my teeth in a
thing....</p>

<p><span class="small-c">MUMMY</span>. You wish to marry her to the Student? Why? He is nothing and has
nothing.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">HUMMEL</span>. He will be rich, thanks to me.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">MUMMY</span>. Have you been invited for to-night?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">HUMMEL</span>. No, but I intend to get an invitation for your spook supper.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">MUMMY</span>. Do you know who will be here?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">HUMMEL</span>. Not quite.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">MUMMY</span>. The Baron&mdash;he who lives above us, and whose father-in-law was
buried this afternoon....</p>

<p><span class="small-c">HUMMEL</span>. The man who is getting a divorce to marry the daughter of the
Janitress.... The man who used to be&mdash;your lover!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">MUMMY</span>. Another guest will be your former fiancée, who was seduced by my
husband....</p>

<p><span class="small-c">HUMMEL</span>. Very select company!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">MUMMY</span>. If the Lord would let us die! Oh, that we might only die!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">HUMMEL</span>. But why do you continue to associate?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">MUMMY</span>. Crime and guilt and secrets bind us together, don't you know?
Our ties have snapped so that we have slipped apart innumerable times,
but we are always drawn together again....</p>

<p><span class="small-c">HUMMEL</span>. I think the Colonel is coming.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">MUMMY</span>. I'll go in to Adèle, then.... [<i>Pause</i>] Consider what you do,
Jacob! Spare him....</p>

<blockquote>

<p>[<i>Pause; then she goes out</i>.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="small-c">COLONEL</span>. [<i>Enters, haughty and reserved</i>] Won't you be seated, please?</p>

<blockquote>

<p><span class="small-c">HUMMEL</span> <i>seats himself with great deliberation; pause</i>.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="small-c">COLONEL</span>. [<i>Staring at his visitor</i>] You wrote this letter, sir?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">HUMMEL</span>. I did.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">COLONEL</span>. Your name is Hummel?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">HUMMEL</span>. It is. [<i>Pause</i>.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">COLONEL</span>. As I learn that you have bought up all my unpaid and overdue
notes, I conclude that I am at your mercy. What do you want?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">HUMMEL</span>. Payment&mdash;in one way or another.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">COLONEL</span>. In what way?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">HUMMEL</span>. A very simple one. Let us not talk of the money. All you have
to do is to admit me as a guest....</p>

<p><span class="small-c">COLONEL</span>. If a little thing like that will satisfy you....</p>

<p><span class="small-c">HUMMEL</span>. I thank you.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">COLONEL</span>. Anything more?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">HUMMEL</span>. Discharge Bengtsson.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">COLONEL</span>. Why should I do so? My devoted servant, who has been with me a
lifetime, and who has the medal for long and faithful service.... Why
should I discharge him?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">HUMMEL</span>. Those wonderful merits exist only in your imagination. He is
not the man he seems to be.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">COLONEL</span>. <i>Who is</i>?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">HUMMEL</span>. [<i>Taken back</i>] True!&mdash;But Bengtsson must go!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">COLONEL</span>. Do you mean to order my household?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">HUMMEL</span>. I do ... as everything visible here belongs to me ...
furniture, draperies, dinner ware, linen and other things!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">COLONEL</span>. What other things?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">HUMMEL</span>. Everything! All that is to be seen is mine! I own it!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">COLONEL</span>. Granted! But for all that, my coat of arms and my unspotted
name belong to myself.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">HUMMEL</span>. No&mdash;not even that much! [<i>Pause</i>] You are not a nobleman!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">COLONEL</span>. Take care!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">HUMMEL</span>. [<i>Producing a document</i>] If you'll read this extract from the
armorial, you will see that the family whose name you are using has
been extinct for a century.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">COLONEL</span>. [<i>Reading the document</i>] I have heard rumours to that effect,
but the name was my father's before it was mine.... [<i>Reading again</i>]
That's right! Yes, you are right&mdash;I am not a nobleman! Not even
that!&mdash;Then I may as well take off my signet-ring.... Oh, I remember
now.... It belongs to you.... If you please!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">HUMMEL</span>. [<i>Accepting the ring and putting it into his pocket</i>] We had
better continue. You are no colonel, either.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">COLONEL</span>. Am I not?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">HUMMEL</span>. No, you have simply held the title of colonel in the American
volunteer service by special appointment. After the war in Cuba and the
reorganisation of the army, all titles of that kind were abolished....</p>

<p><span class="small-c">COLONEL</span>. Is that true?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">HUMMEL</span>. [<i>With a gesture toward his pocket</i>] Do you wish to see for
yourself?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">COLONEL</span>. No, it won't be necessary.&mdash;Who are you, anyhow, and with what
right are you stripping me naked in this fashion?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">HUMMEL</span>. You'll see by and by. As to stripping you naked&mdash;do you know
who you are in reality?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">COLONEL</span>. How dare you?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">HUMMEL</span>. Take off that wig, and have a look at yourself in the mirror.
Take out that set of false teeth and shave off your moustache, too. Let
Bengtsson remove the iron stays&mdash;and perhaps a certain X Y Z, a lackey,
may begin to recognise himself&mdash;the man who used to visit the maid's
chamber in a certain house for a bite of something good....</p>

<blockquote>

<p><i>The</i> <span class="small-c">COLONEL</span> <i>makes a movement toward a table on which stands
a bell, but is checked by</i> <span class="small-c">HUMMEL</span>.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="small-c">HUMMEL</span>. Don't touch that bell, and don't call Bengtsson! If you do,
I'll have him arrested.... Now the guests are beginning to arrive....
Keep your composure, and let us continue to play our old parts for a
while.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">COLONEL</span>. Who are you? Your eyes and your voice remind me of somebody....</p>

<p><span class="small-c">HUMMEL</span>. Don't try to find out! Keep silent and obey!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">STUDENT</span>. [<i>Enters and bows to the</i> <span class="small-c">COLONEL</span>] Colonel!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">COLONEL</span>. I bid you welcome to my house, young man. Your splendid
behaviour in connection with that great disaster has brought your name
to everybody's lips, and I count it an honour to receive you here....</p>

<p><span class="small-c">STUDENT</span>. Being a man of humble birth, Colonel and considering your name
and position....</p>

<p><span class="small-c">COLONEL</span>. May I introduce?&mdash;Mr. Arkenholtz&mdash;Mr. Hummel. The ladies are
in there, Mr. Arkenholtz&mdash;if you please&mdash;I have a few more things to
talk over with Mr. Hummel....</p>

<blockquote>

<p><i>Guided by the</i> <span class="small-c">COLONEL</span>, <i>the</i> <span class="small-c">STUDENT</span> <i>goes into the Hyacinth
Room, where he remains visible, standing beside the</i> <span class="small-c">YOUNG LADY</span>
<i>and talking very timidly to her</i>.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="small-c">COLONEL</span>. A splendid young chap&mdash;very musical&mdash;sings, and writes
poetry.... If he were only a nobleman&mdash;if he belonged to our class, I
don't think I should object....</p>

<p><span class="small-c">HUMMEL</span>. To what?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">COLONEL</span>. Oh, my daughter....</p>

<p><span class="small-c">HUMMEL</span>. <i>Your</i> daughter, you say?&mdash;But apropos of that, why is she
always sitting in that room?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">COLONEL</span>. She has to spend all her time in the Hyacinth Room when she is
not out. That is a peculiarity of hers.... Here comes Miss Betty von
Holstein-Kron&mdash;a charming woman&mdash;a Secular Canoness, with just enough
money of her own to suit her birth and position....</p>

<p>Hummel. [<i>To</i><i>himself</i>] My fiancée!</p>

<blockquote>

<p><i>The</i> <span class="small-c">FIANCÉE</span> <i>curtseys in old-fashioned manner and takes a
seat. The</i> <span class="small-c">DANDY</span> <i>enters and seats himself; he is in mourning
and has a very mysterious look.</i></p></blockquote>

<p><span class="small-c">COLONEL</span>. Baron Skansenkorge....</p>

<p><span class="small-c">HUMMEL</span>. [<i>Aside, without rising</i>] That's the jewelry thief, I think....
[<i>To the</i> <span class="small-c">COLONEL</span>] If you bring in the Mummy, our gathering will be
complete.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">COLONEL</span>. [<i>Going to the door of the Hyacinth Room</i>] Polly!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">MUMMY</span>. [<i>Enters</i>] Currrrr!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">COLONEL</span>. How about the young people?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">HUMMEL</span>. No, not the young people! They must be spared.</p>

<blockquote>

<p><i>The company is seated in a circle, no one saying a word for a
while</i>.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="small-c">COLONEL</span>. Shall we order the tea now?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">HUMMEL</span>. What's the use? No one cares for tea, and I can't see the need
of pretending. [<i>Pause</i>.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">COLONEL</span>. Shall we make conversation?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">HUMMEL</span>. [<i>Speaking slowly and with frequent pauses</i>.] Talk of the
weather, which we know all about? Ask one another's state of health,
which we know just as well? I prefer silence. Then thoughts become
audible, and we can see the past. Silence can hide nothing&mdash;but words
can. I read the other day that the differentiation of languages had its
origin in the desire among savage peoples to keep their tribal secrets
hidden from outsiders. This means that every language is a code, and
he who finds the universal key can understand every language in the
world&mdash;which does not prevent the secret from becoming revealed without
any key at times, and especially when the fact of paternity is to be
proved&mdash;but, of course, legal proof is a different matter. Two false
witnesses suffice to prove, anything on which they agree, but you don't
bring any witnesses along on the kind of expedition I have in mind.
Nature herself has planted in man a sense of modesty, which tends to
hide that which should be hidden. But we slip into situations unawares,
and now and then a favourable chance will reveal the most cherished
secret, stripping the impostor of his mask, and exposing the villain....</p>

<blockquote>

<p><i>Long pause during which everybody is subject to silent
scrutiny by all the rest</i>.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="small-c">HUMMEL</span>. How silent everybody is! [<i>Long silence</i>] Here, for instance,
in this respectable house, this attractive home, where beauty and
erudition and wealth have joined hands.... [<i>Long silence</i>] All of
us sitting here now&mdash;we know who we are, don't we? I don't need to
tell.... And all of you know me, although you pretend ignorance.... In
the next room is my daughter&mdash;<i>mine</i>, as you know perfectly well. She
has lost the desire to live without knowing why.... The fact is that
she has been pining away in this air charged with crime and deceit and
falsehood of every kind.... That is the reason why I have looked for
a friend in whose company she may enjoy the light and heat radiated
by noble deeds [<i>Long silence</i>] Here is my mission in this house: to
tear up the weeds, to expose the crimes, to settle all accounts, so
that those young people may start life with a clean slate in a home
that is my gift to them. [<i>Long silence</i>] Now I grant you safe retreat.
Everybody may leave in his due turn. Whoever stays will be arrested.
[<i>Long silence</i>] Do you hear that clock ticking like the deathwatch
hidden in a wall? Can you hear what it says?&mdash;"It's time! It's
time!"&mdash;When it strikes in a few seconds, your time will be up, and
then you can go, but not before. You may notice, too, that the clock
shakes its fist at you before it strikes. Listen! There it is! "Better
beware," it says.... And I can strike, too [<i>He raps the top of a table
with one of his crutches</i>] Do you hear?</p>

<blockquote>

<p><i>For a while everybody remains silent</i>.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="small-c">MUMMY</span>. [<i>Goes up to the dock and stops it; then she speaks in a normal
and dignified tone</i>] But I can stop time in its course. I can wipe
out the past and undo what is done. Bribes won't do that, nor will
threats&mdash;but suffering and repentance will [<i>She goes to</i> <span class="small-c">HUMMEL</span>] We
are miserable human creatures, and we know it. We have erred and we
have sinned&mdash;we, like everybody else. We are not what we seem, but
at bottom we are better than ourselves because we disapprove of our
own misdeeds. And when you, Jacob Hummel, with your assumed name,
propose to sit in judgment on us, you merely prove yourself worse than
all the rest. You are not the one you seem to be&mdash;no more than we!
You are a thief of human souls! You stole mine once upon a time by
means of false promises. You killed the Consul, whom they buried this
afternoon&mdash;strangling him with debts. You are now trying to steal the
soul of the Student with the help of an imaginary claim against his
father, who never owed you a farthing....</p>

<p><span class="small-c">MUMMY</span>. There is one dark spot in your life concerning which I am not
certain, although I have my suspicions.... I believe Bengtsson can
throw light on it.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">MUMMY</span>. Do you know this man, Bengtsson?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">BENGTSSON</span>. Oh yes, I know him, and he knows me. Life has its ups and
downs, as you know. I have been in his service, and he has been in
mine. For two years he came regularly to our kitchen to be fed by our
cook. Because he had to be at work at a certain hour, she made the
dinner far ahead of time, and we had to be satisfied with the warmed-up
leavings of that beast. He drank the soup-stock, so that we got nothing
but water. Like a vampire, the sucked the house of all nourishment,
until we became reduced to mere skeletons&mdash;and he nearly got us into
jail when we dared to call the cook a thief. Later I met that man in
Hamburg, where he had another name. Then he was a money-lender, a
regular leech. While there, he was accused of having lured a young girl
out on the ice in order to drown her, because she had seen him commit a
crime, and he was afraid of being exposed....</p>

<blockquote>

<p><i>A room furnished in rather bizarre fashion. The general effect
of it is Oriental. Hyacinths of different colours are scattered
everywhere. On the mantelshelf of the fireplace is seen a huge,
seated Buddha, in whose lap rests a bulb. From that bulb rises
the stalk of a shallot</i> (Allium Ascalonicum), <i>spreading aloft
its almost globular cluster of white, starlike flowers</i>.</p>

<p><i>An open door in the rear wall, toward the right-hand side,
leads to the Round Room, where the</i> <span class="small-c">COLONEL</span> <i>and the</i> <span class="small-c">MUMMY</span>
<i>are seated. They don't stir and don't utter a word. A part of
the Death Screen is also visible</i>.</p>

<p><i>Another door, at the left, leads to the pantry and the
kitchen. The</i> <span class="small-c">YOUNG LADY</span> <i>[Adèle] and the</i> <span class="small-c">STUDENT</span> <i>are
discovered near a table. She is seated at her harp, and he
stands beside her</i>.</p></blockquote>


<p><span class="small-c">YOUNG LADY</span>. Sing to my flowers.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">STUDENT</span>. Is this the flower of your soul?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">YOUNG LADY</span>. The one and only.&mdash;Are you fond of the hyacinth?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">STUDENT</span>. I love it above all other flowers. I love its virginal shape
rising straight and slender out of the bulb that rests on the water and
sends its pure white rootlets down into the colourless fluid. I love
the colour of it, whether innocently white as snow or sweetly yellow
as honey; whether youthfully pink or maturely red; but above all if
blue&mdash;with the deep-eyed, faith-inspiring blue of the morning sky. I
love these flowers, one and all; love them more than pearls or gold,
and have loved them ever since I was a child. I have always admired
them, too, because they possess every handsome quality that I lack....
And yet....</p>

<p><span class="small-c">YOUNG LADY</span>. What?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">STUDENT</span>. My love is unrequited. These beautiful blossoms hate me.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">YOUNG LADY</span>. How do you mean?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">STUDENT</span>. Their fragrance, powerful and pure as the winds of early
spring, which have passed over melting snow&mdash;it seems to confuse my
senses, to make me deaf and blind, to crowd me out of the room, to
bombard me with poisoned arrows that hurt my heart and set my head on
fire. Do you know the legend of that flower?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">YOUNG LADY</span>. Tell me about it.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">STUDENT</span>. Let us first interpret its symbolism; The bulb is the earth,
resting on the water or buried in the soil. From that the stalk rises,
straight as the axis of the universe. At its upper end appear the
six-pointed, starlike flowers.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">YOUNG LADY</span>. Above the earth&mdash;the stars! What lofty thought! Where did
you find it? How did you discover it?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">STUDENT</span>. Let me think.... In your eyes!&mdash;It is, therefore, an image of
the Cosmos. And that is the reason why Buddha is holding the earth-bulb
in his lap, brooding on it with a steady gaze, in order that he may
behold it spread outward and upward as it becomes transformed into a
heaven.... This poor earth must turn into a heaven! That is what Buddha
is waiting for!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">YOUNG LADY</span>. I see now.... Are not the snow crystals six-pointed, too, like
the hyacinth-lily?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">STUDENT</span>. You are right! Thus the snow crystal is a falling star....</p>

<p><span class="small-c">YOUNG LADY</span>. And the snowdrop is a star of snow&mdash;grown out of the snow.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">STUDENT</span>. But the largest and most beautiful of all the stars in the
firmament, the red and yellow Sirius, is the narcissus, with its
yellow-and-red cup and its six white rays....</p>

<p><span class="small-c">YOUNG LADY</span>. Have you seen the shallot bloom?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">STUDENT</span>. Indeed, I have! It hides its flowers within a ball, a globe
resembling the celestial one, and strewn, like that, with white
stars....</p>

<p><span class="small-c">YOUNG LADY</span>. What a tremendous thought! Whose was it?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">STUDENT</span>. Yours!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">YOUNG LADY</span>. No, yours!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">STUDENT</span>. Ours, then! We have jointly given birth to something: we are
wedded....</p>

<p><span class="small-c">YOUNG LADY</span>. Not yet.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">STUDENT</span>. What more remains?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">YOUNG LADY</span>. To await the coming ordeal in patience!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">STUDENT</span>. I am ready for it. [<i>Pause</i>] Tell me! Why do your parents sit
there so silently, without saying a single word?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">YOUNG LADY</span>. Because they have nothing to say to each other, and because
neither one believes what the other says. This is the way my father
puts it: "What is the use of talking, when you can't fool each other
anyhow?"</p>

<p><span class="small-c">STUDENT</span>. That's horrible....</p>

<p><span class="small-c">YOUNG LADY</span>. Here comes the Cook.... Look! how big and fat she is!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">STUDENT</span>. What does she want?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">YOUNG LADY</span>. Ask me about the dinner.... You see, I am looking after the
house during my mother's illness.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">STUDENT</span>. Have we to bother about the kitchen, too?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">YOUNG LADY</span>. We must eat.... Look at that Cook.... I can't bear the
sight of her....</p>

<p><span class="small-c">STUDENT</span>. What kind of a monster is she?</p>

<p>Young Lady. She belongs to the Hummel family of vampires. She is eating
us alive.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">STUDENT</span>. Why don't you discharge her?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">YOUNG LADY</span>. Because she won't leave. We can do nothing with her, and
we have got her for the sake of our sins.... Don't you see that we are
pining and wasting away?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">STUDENT</span>. Don't you get enough to eat?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">YOUNG LADY</span>. Plenty of dishes, but with all the nourishment gone from
the food. She boils the life out of the beef, and drinks the stock
herself, while we get nothing but fibres and water. In the same way,
when we have roast, she squeezes it dry. Then she eats the gravy and
drinks the juice herself. She takes the strength and savour out of
everything she touches. It is as if her eyes were leeches. When she has
had coffee, we get the grounds. She drinks the wine and puts water into
the bottles....</p>

<p><span class="small-c">STUDENT</span>. Kick her out!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">YOUNG LADY</span>. We can't!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">STUDENT</span>. Why not?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">YOUNG LADY</span>. We don't know! But she won't leave! And nobody can do
anything with her. She has taken all our strength away from us.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">STUDENT</span>. Will you let me dispose of her?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">YOUNG LADY</span>. No! It has to be as it is, I suppose.&mdash;Here she is now. She
will ask me what I wish for dinner, and I tell her, and then she will
make objections, and in the end she has her own way.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">STUDENT</span>. Why don't you leave it to her entirely?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">YOUNG LADY</span>. She won't let me.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">STUDENT</span>. What a strange house! It seems to be bewitched!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">YOUNG LADY</span>. It is!&mdash;Now she turned back on seeing you here.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">COOK</span>. [<i>Appearing suddenly in the doorway at that very moment</i>] Naw,
that was not the reason.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>[<i>She grins so that every tooth can be seen</i>.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="small-c">STUDENT</span>. Get out of here!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">COOK</span>. When it suits me! [<i>Pause</i>] Now it does suit me!</p>

<blockquote>

<p>[<i>She disappears</i>.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="small-c">YOUNG LADY</span>. Don't lose your temper! You must practise patience.
She is part of the ordeal we have to face in this house. We have a
chambermaid, too, after whom we have to put everything back where it
belongs.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">STUDENT</span>. Now I am sinking! <i>Cor in aethere!</i> Music!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">YOUNG LADY</span>. Wait!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">STUDENT</span>. Music!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">YOUNG LADY</span>. Patience!&mdash;This is named the Room of Ordeal.... It is
beautiful to look at, but is full of imperfections.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">STUDENT</span>. Incredible! Yet such things have to be borne. It is very
beautiful, although a little cold. Why don't you have a fire?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">YOUNG LADY</span>. Because the smoke comes into the room.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">STUDENT</span>. Have the chimney swept!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">YOUNG LADY</span>. It doesn't help.&mdash;Do you see that writing-table?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">STUDENT</span>. Remarkably handsome!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">YOUNG LADY</span>. But one leg is too short. Every day I put a piece of cork
under that leg. Every day the chambermaid takes it away when she sweeps
the room. Every day I have to cut a new piece. Both my penholder and my
inkstand are covered with ink every morning, and I have to clean them
after that woman&mdash;as sure as the sun rises. [<i>Pause]</i> What is the worst
thing you can think of?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">STUDENT</span>. To count the wash. Ugh!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">YOUNG LADY</span>. That's what I have to do. Ugh!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">STUDENT</span>. Anything else?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">YOUNG LADY</span>. To be waked out of your sleep and have to get up and dose
the window&mdash;which the chambermaid has left unlatched.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">STUDENT</span>. Anything else?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">YOUNG LADY</span>. To get up on a ladder and tie on the cord which the
chambermaid has torn from the window-shade.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">STUDENT</span>. Anything else?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">YOUNG LADY</span>. To sweep after her; to dust after her; to start the fire
again, after she has merely thrown some wood into the fireplace! To
watch the damper in the fireplace; to wipe every glass; to set the
table over again; to open the wine-bottles; to see that the rooms are
aired; to make over your bed; to rinse the water-bottle that is green
with sediment; to buy matches and soap, which are always lacking; to
wipe the chimneys and cut the wicks in order to keep the lamps from
smoking and in order to keep them from going out when we have company,
I have to fill them myself....</p>

<p><span class="small-c">STUDENT</span>. Music!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">YOUNG LADY</span>. Wait! The labour comes first&mdash;the labour of keeping the
filth of life at a distance.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">STUDENT</span>. But you are wealthy, and you have two servants?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">YOUNG LADY</span>. What does that help? What would it help to have three? It
is troublesome to live, and at times I get tired.... Think, then, of adding
a nursery!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">STUDENT</span>. The greatest of joys....</p>

<p><span class="small-c">YOUNG LADY</span>. And the costliest.... Is life really worth so much trouble?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">STUDENT</span>. It depends on the reward you expect for your labours.... To
win your hand I would face anything.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">YOUNG LADY</span>. Don't talk like that. You can never get me.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">STUDENT</span>. Why?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">YOUNG LADY</span>. You mustn't ask.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>[<i>Pause</i>.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="small-c">STUDENT</span>. You dropped your bracelet out of the window....</p>

<p><span class="small-c">YOUNG LADY</span>. Yes, because my hand has grown too small....</p>

<blockquote>

<p>[<i>Pause</i>.</p>

<p><i>The</i> <span class="small-c">COOK</span> <i>appears with a bottle of Japanese soy in her hand</i>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><span class="small-c">YOUNG LADY</span>. There is the one that eats me and all the rest
alive.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">STUDENT</span>. What has she in her hand?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">COOK</span>. This is my colouring bottle that has letters on it
looking like scorpions. It's the soy that turns water into
bouillon, and that takes the place of gravy. You can make
cabbage soup out of it, or mock-turtle soup, if you prefer.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">STUDENT</span>. Out with you!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">COOK</span>. You take the sap out of us, and we out of you. We keep
the blood for ourselves and leave you the water&mdash;with the
colouring. It's the colour that counts! Now I shall leave, but
I stay just the same&mdash;as long as I please!</p>

<blockquote>

<p>[<i>She goes out</i>.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="small-c">STUDENT</span>. Why has Bengtsson got a medal?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">YOUNG LADY</span>. On account of his great merits.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">STUDENT</span>. Has he no faults?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">YOUNG LADY</span>. Yes, great ones, but faults bring you no medals, you know.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>[<i>Both smile</i>.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="small-c">STUDENT</span>. You have a lot of secrets in this house....</p>

<p><span class="small-c">YOUNG LADY</span>. As in all houses.... Permit us to keep ours! [<i>Pause</i>.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">STUDENT</span>. Do you care for frankness?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">YOUNG LADY</span>. Within reason.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">STUDENT</span>. At times I am seized with a passionate craving to say all
I think.... Yet I know that the world would go to pieces if perfect
frankness were the rule. [<i>Pause</i> I attended a funeral the other
day&mdash;in one of the churches&mdash;and it was very solemn and beautiful.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">YOUNG LADY</span>. That of Mr. Hummel?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">STUDENT</span>. Yes, that of my pretended benefactor. An elderly friend of the
deceased acted as mace-bearer and stood at the head of the coffin. I
was particularly impressed by the dignified manner and moving words of
the minister. I had to cry&mdash;everybody cried.... A number of us went to
a restaurant afterward, and there I learned that the man with the mace
had been rather too friendly with the dead man's son....</p>

<blockquote>

<p><i>The</i> <span class="small-c">YOUNG LADY</span> <i>stares at him, trying to make out the meaning
of his words</i>.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="small-c">STUDENT</span>. I learned, too, that the dead man had borrowed money of his
son's devoted friend.... [<i>Pause</i>] And the next day the minister was
arrested for embezzling the church funds.&mdash;Nice, isn't it?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">YOUNG LADY</span>. Oh! [<i>Pause</i>.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">STUDENT</span>. Do you know what I am thinking of you now?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">YOUNG LADY</span>. Don't tell, or I'll die!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">STUDENT</span>. I must, lest <i>I</i> die!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">YOUNG LADY</span>. It is only in the asylum you say all that you think....</p>

<p><span class="small-c">STUDENT</span>. Exactly! My father died in a madhouse....</p>

<p><span class="small-c">YOUNG LADY</span>. Was he sick?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">STUDENT</span>. No, perfectly well, and yet mad. It broke out at last, and
these were the circumstances. Like all of us, he was surrounded by
a circle of acquaintances whom he called friends for the sake of
convenience, and they were a lot of scoundrels, of course, as most
people are. He had to have some society, however, as he couldn't sit
all alone. As you know, no one tells people what he thinks of them
under ordinary circumstances, and my father didn't do so either.
He knew that they were false, and he knew the full extent of their
perfidy, but, being a wise man and well brought up, he remained
always polite. One day he gave a big party.... It was in the evening,
naturally, and he was tired out by a hard day's work. Then the strain
of keeping his thoughts to himself while talking a lot of damned rot
to his guests.... [<i>The</i> <span class="small-c">YOUNG LADY</span> <i>is visibly shocked</i>] Well, while
they were still at the table, he rapped for silence, raised his glass,
and began to speak.... Then something loosed the trigger, and in a long
speech he stripped the whole company naked, one by one, telling them
all he knew about their treacheries. At last, when utterly tired out,
he sat down on the table itself and told them all to go to hell!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">YOUNG LADY</span>. Oh!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">STUDENT</span>. I was present, and I shall never forget what happened after
that. My parents had a fight, the guests rushed for the doors&mdash;and
my father was taken to a madhouse, where he died! [<i>Pause</i>] To keep
silent too long is like letting water stagnate so that it rots. That is
what has happened in this house. There is something rotten here. And
yet I thought it paradise itself when I saw you enter here the first
time.... It was a Sunday morning, and I stood gazing into these rooms.
Here I saw a Colonel who was no colonel. I had a generous benefactor
who was a robber and had to hang himself. I saw a Mummy who was not a
mummy, and a maiden&mdash;how about the maidenhood, by the by?... Where is
beauty to be found? In nature, and in my own mind when it has donned
its Sunday clothes. Where do we find honour and faith? In fairy-tales
and childish fancies. Where can I find anything that keeps its promise?
Only in my own imagination!... Your flowers have poisoned me and now
I am squirting their poison back at you.... I asked you to become my
wife in a home full of poetry, and song, and music; and then the
Cook appeared.... <i>Sursum corda!</i> Try once more to strike fire and
purple out of the golden harp.... Try, I ask you, I implore you on my
knees.... [<i>As she does not move</i>] Then I must do it myself! [<i>He picks
up the harp, but is unable to make its strings sound</i>] It has grown
deaf and dumb! Only think that the most beautiful flower of all can
be so poisonous&mdash;that it can be more poisonous than any other one....
There must be a curse on all creation and on life itself.... Why did
you not want to become my bride? Because the very well-spring of life
within you has been sickened.... Now I can feel how that vampire in
the kitchen is sucking my life juices.... She must be a Lamia, one of
those that suck the blood of children. It is always in the servants'
quarters that the seed-leaves of the children are nipped, if it has
not already happened in the bedroom.... There are poisons that blind
you, and others that open your eyes more widely. I must have been born
with that second kind of poison, I fear, for I cannot regard what is
ugly as beautiful, or call evil good&mdash;I cannot! They say that Jesus
Christ descended into hell. It refers merely to his wanderings on this
earth&mdash;his descent into that madhouse, that jail, that morgue, the
earth. The madmen killed him when he wished to liberate them, but the
robber was set free. It is always the robber who gets sympathy! Woe!
Woe is all of us! Saviour of the World, save us&mdash;we are perishing!</p>

<blockquote>

<p><i>A German dining-room, with a rectangular dinner-table
occupying the middle of the floor. A huge wardrobe stands at
the right. There is an oven of glazed bricks</i>.</p>

<p><i>The door in the background stands open, disclosing a landscape
with vineyards, above which appears a church spire</i>.</p>

<p><i>At the left is a door papered like the rest of the wait. A
travelling-bag is placed on a chair by the wardrobe</i>.</p>

<p><i>The</i> <span class="small-c">WIFE</span> <i>is writing at the table, on which lie a bunch of
flowers and a pair of gloves</i>.</p></blockquote>


<p><span class="small-c">HUSBAND</span>. [<i>Entering</i>] Good morning&mdash;although it's noon already. Did you
sleep well?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">WIFE</span>. Splendidly, considering the circumstances.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">HUSBAND</span>. Yes, we might have broken away a little earlier from that
party last night....</p>

<p><span class="small-c">WIFE</span>. I seem to remember that you made the same remark a number of
times during the night....</p>

<p><span class="small-c">HUSBAND</span>. [<i>Playing with the flowers</i>] Do you really remember that much?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">WIFE</span>. I remember also that you got mad because I sang too much....
Please don't spoil my flowers!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">HUSBAND</span>. Which previously belonged to the Captain, I suppose?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">WIFE</span>. Yes, and which probably belonged to the gardener before the
florist got them. But now they are mine.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">HUSBAND</span>. [<i>Throwing away the flowers</i>] It's a nice habit they have in
this place&mdash;of sending flowers to other people's wives.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">WIFE</span>. I think it would have been well for you to go to bed a little
earlier.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">HUSBAND</span>. I am perfectly convinced that the Captain was of the same
opinion. But as my one choice was to stay and be made ridiculous, or go
home alone and be made equally ridiculous, I preferred to stay....</p>

<p><span class="small-c">WIFE</span>. ... And make yourself ridiculous.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">HUSBAND</span>. Can you explain why you care to be the wife of a ridiculous
man? I should never care to be the husband of a ridiculous woman.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">WIFE</span>. You are to be pitied!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">HUSBAND</span>. Right you are. Frequently I have thought so myself. But do you
know what is the most tragical feature of my ridiculousness?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">WIFE</span>. I am sure your own answer will be much cleverer than any one I
could give.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">HUSBAND</span>. It is&mdash;that I am in love with my wife after fifteen years of
marriage....</p>

<p><span class="small-c">WIFE</span>. Fifteen years! Have you begun to use a pedometer?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">HUSBAND</span>. For the measurement of my thorny path, you mean? No. But you,
who are dancing on roses, might do well in counting your steps To me
you are still as young as ever&mdash;unfortunately&mdash;while my own hair is
turning grey. But as we are of the same age, my looks should tell you
that you must be growing old yourself....</p>

<p><span class="small-c">WIFE</span>. And that is what you are waiting for?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">HUSBAND</span>. Exactly. How many times have I not wished that you were old
and ugly, that you were pock-marked, that your teeth were gone, just to
have you to myself and be rid of this worry which never leaves me!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">WIFE</span>. How charming! And once you had me old and ugly, then everything
would be so very peaceful until you began to worry about somebody
else, and I was left to enjoy all that peace alone, by myself.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">HUSBAND</span>. No!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">WIFE</span>. Yes! It has been well proved that your love loses its fervour the
moment you have no reason to be jealous. Do you remember last summer,
when there was not a soul on that island but we two? You were away all
day, fishing, hunting, getting up an appetite, putting on flesh&mdash;and
developing a self-assurance that was almost insulting.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">HUSBAND</span>. And yet I recall being jealous&mdash;of the hired man.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">WIFE</span>. Merciful Heavens!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">HUSBAND</span>. Yes, I noticed that you couldn't give him an order without
making conversation; that you couldn't send him out to cut some wood
without first having inquired about the state of his health, his future
prospects, and his love-affairs.... You are blushing, I think?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">WIFE</span>. Because I am ashamed of you....</p>

<p><span class="small-c">HUSBAND</span> ... Who....</p>

<p><span class="small-c">WIFE</span>. ... Have no sense of shame whatever.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">HUSBAND</span>. Yes, so you say. But will you please tell me why you hate me?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">WIFE</span>. I don't hate you. I simply despise you! Why? Probably for the
same reason that makes me despise all men as soon as they&mdash;what do you
call it?&mdash;are in love with me. I am like that, and I can't tell why.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">HUSBAND</span>. So I have observed, and my warmest wish has been that I might
hate you, so that you might love me. Woe is the man who loves his own
wife!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">WIFE</span>. Yes, you are to be pitied, and so am I, but what can be done?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">HUSBAND</span>. Nothing. We have roved and roamed for seven years, hoping that
some circumstance, some chance, might bring about a change. I have
tried to fall in love with others, and have failed. In the meantime
your eternal contempt and my own continued ridiculousness have stripped
me of all courage, all faith in myself, all power to act. Six times I
have run away from you&mdash;and now I shall make my seventh attempt. [<i>He
rises and picks up the travelling-bag</i>.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">WIFE</span>. So those little trips of yours were attempts to run away?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">HUSBAND</span>. Futile attempts! The last time I got as far as Genoa. I went
to the galleries, but saw no pictures&mdash;only you. I went to the opera,
but heard nobody&mdash;only your voice back of every note. I went to a
Pompeian café, and the one woman that pleased me looked like you&mdash;or
seemed to do so later.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">WIFE</span>. [<i>Revolted</i>] You have visited places of that kind?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">HUSBAND</span>. Yes, that far have I been carried by my love&mdash;and by my
virtue, which has embarrassed me by making me ridiculous.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">WIFE</span>. That's the end of everything between us two!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">HUSBAND</span>. So I suppose, as I can't make you jealous.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">WIFE</span>. No, I don't know what it is to be jealous&mdash;not even of Rose, who
loves you to distraction.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">HUSBAND</span>. How ungrateful of me not to notice it! On the other hand, I
have had my suspicions of the old Baroness, who is all the time finding
excuses for visiting that big wardrobe over there. But as she is our
landlady, and the furniture belongs to her, I may be mistaken as to
the motive that makes our rooms so attractive to her.... Now I'll get
dressed, and in half an hour I shall be gone&mdash;without any farewells, if
you please!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">WIFE</span>. You seem rather afraid of farewells.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">HUSBAND</span>. Particularly when you are concerned in them!</p>

<blockquote>

<p><i>He goes out. The</i> <span class="small-c">WIFE</span> <i>remains alone a few moments. Then</i>
<span class="small-c">ROSE</span> <i>enters. She is carelessly dressed, and her hair is down.
A scarf wrapped about her head and covering her cheeks and chin
indicates toothache. There is a hole on the left sleeve of her
dress, which ends half-way between her knees and her ankles</i>.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="small-c">WIFE</span>. Well, Rose!&mdash;What's the matter, child?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ROSE</span>. Good morning, Mrs. Brunner. I have such a toothache that I wish I
were dead!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">WIFE</span>. Poor little thing!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ROSE</span>. To-morrow is the Corpus Christi festival, and I was to walk in
the procession&mdash;and to-day I should be binding my wreath of roses, and
Mr. Axel has promised to help me with it.... Oh, those teeth!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">WIFE</span>. Let me see if there are any signs of decay&mdash;open your mouth
now!&mdash;What wonderful teeth you have! Perfect pearls, my dear child!
[<i>She kisses</i> ROSE <i>on the mouth</i>.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ROSE</span>. [<i>Annoyed</i>] You mustn't kiss me, Mrs. Olga! You mustn't! I don't
want it! [<i>She climbs up on the table and puts her feet on one of the
chairs</i> ] Really, I don't know what I want! I should have liked to
go to that party yesterday&mdash;but I was forced to stay at home all by
myself in order to get my lessons done&mdash;just as if I were nothing but
a child&mdash;and then I have to sit on the same bench with those kids!
But all the same I won't let the Captain chuck me under the chin any
longer, for I am no child! No, I am not! And if my mother tries to pull
my hair again&mdash;I don't know what I'll do to her!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">WIFE</span>. What's the matter, my dear Rose? What has happened, anyhow?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ROSE</span>. I don't know what is the matter, but I have shooting pains in
my head and in my teeth, and I feel as if I had a red-hot iron in my
back&mdash;and I am disgusted with life. I should like to drown myself. I
should like to run away, and go from one fair to another, and sing,
and be insulted by all sorts of impudent fellows....</p>

<p><span class="small-c">WIFE</span>. Listen, Rose! Listen to me now!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ROSE</span>. I wish I had a baby! Oh, I wish it were not such an awful
shame to have a baby! Oh, Mrs. Olga [<i>She catches sight of the
travelling-bag</i>] Who is going away?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">WIFE</span>. My ... my husband.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ROSE</span>. Then you have been nasty to him again, Mrs. Olga.&mdash;Where is he
going? Is he going far away? When will he be back?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">WIFE</span>. I&mdash;<i>I</i> know nothing at all!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ROSE</span>. Oh, you don't? Haven't you asked him even? [<i>She begins to
ransack the bag</i>] But I&mdash;<i>I</i> can see that he is going far away, because
here is his passport. Very far, I am sure! How far, do you think?&mdash;Oh,
Mrs. Olga, why can't you be nice to him, when he is so kind to you?</p>

<blockquote>

<p>[<i>She throws herself weeping into the arms of Mrs. Brunner</i>.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="small-c">WIFE</span>. Now, now, my dear child! Poor little girl&mdash;is she crying? Poor,
innocent heart!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ROSE</span>. I like Mr. Axel so much!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">WIFE</span>. And you are not ashamed of saying so to his own wife? And you
want me to console you&mdash;you, who are my little rival?&mdash;Well, have a
good cry, my dear child. That helps a whole lot.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ROSE</span>. [<i>Tearing herself away</i>] No! If I don't want to cry, I don't have
to! And if it suits me to pick up what you are throwing away, I'll do
so!&mdash;I don't ask any one's permission to like anybody or anything!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">WIFE</span>. Well, well, well! But are you so sure that he likes you?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ROSE</span>. [<i>Throwing herself into the elder woman's arms again, weeping</i>]
No, I am not.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">WIFE</span>. [<i>Tenderly, as if talking to a baby</i>] And now perhaps you want
me to ask Mr. Axel to like you? Is that what Mrs. Olga has to do?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ROSE</span>. [<i>Weeping</i>] Ye-es!&mdash;And he mustn't go away! He mustn't!&mdash;Please
be nice to him, Mrs. Olga! Then he won't go away.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">WIFE</span>. What in the world am I going to do, you little silly?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ROSE</span>. I don't know. But you might let him kiss you as much as he
wishes.... I was watching you in the garden the other day, when he
wanted, and you didn't&mdash;and then I thought....</p>

<p><span class="small-c">BARONESS</span>. [<i>Entering</i>] Sorry to disturb you, madam, but with your
permission I should like to get into the wardrobe.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">WIFE</span>. [<i>Rising</i>] You're perfectly welcome, Baroness.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">BARONESS</span>. Oh, there is Rose.&mdash;So you are up again, and I thought you
were in bed!&mdash;Go back to your lessons at once.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ROSE</span>. But you know, mamma, we have no school to-morrow because of the
festival.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">BARONESS</span>. You had better go anyhow, and don't bother Mr. and Mrs.
Brunner all the time.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">WIFE</span>. [<i>Edging toward the door in the background</i>] Oh, Rose is not
bothering us at all. We couldn't be better friends than we are.... We
were just going into the garden to pick some flowers, and then we meant
to try on the white dress Rose is to wear to-morrow.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ROSE</span>. [<i>Disappears through the door in the background with a nod of
secret understanding to the</i> <span class="small-c">WIFE</span>] Thank you!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">BARONESS</span>. You are spoiling Rose fearfully.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">WIFE</span>. A little kindness won't spoil anybody, and least of all a girl
like Rose, who has a remarkable heart and a head to match it.</p>

<blockquote>

<p><i>The</i> <span class="small-c">BARONESS</span> <i>is digging around in the wardrobe for
something. The</i> <span class="small-c">WIFE</span> <i>stands in the doorway in the rear.
Entering by the door at the left with a number of packages,
the</i> <span class="small-c">HUSBAND</span> <i>exchanges a glance of mutual understanding with
his wife. Then hath watch the</i> <span class="small-c">BARONESS</span> <i>smilingly for a
moment. At last the</i> <span class="small-c">WIFE</span> <i>goes out, and the</i> <span class="small-c">HUSBAND</span> <i>begins
to put his packages into the travelling-bag</i>.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="small-c">BARONESS</span>. Pardon me for disturbing you.... I'll be through in a
moment....</p>

<p><span class="small-c">HUSBAND</span>. Please don't mind me, Baroness.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">BARONESS</span>. [<i>Emerging from the wardrobe</i>] Are you going away again, Mr.
Brunner?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">HUSBAND</span>. I am.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">BARONESS</span>. Far?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">HUSBAND</span>. Perhaps&mdash;and perhaps not.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">BARONESS</span>. Don't you know?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">HUSBAND</span>. I never know anything about my own fate after having placed it
in the hands of another person.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">BARONESS</span>. Will you pardon me a momentary impertinence, Mr. Brunner?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">HUSBAND</span>. That depends.... You are very friendly with my wife, are you
not?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">BARONESS</span>. As friendly as two women can be with each other. But my
age, my experience of life, my temperament.... [<i>She checks herself
abruptly</i>] However&mdash;I have seen that you are unhappy, and as I have
suffered in the same way myself, I know that nothing but time will cure
your disease.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">HUSBAND</span>. Is it really I who am diseased? Is not my behaviour quite
normal? And is not my suffering caused by seeing other people behave
abnormally or&mdash;pathologically?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">BARONESS</span>. I was married to a man whom I loved.... Yes, you smile! You
think a woman cannot love because.... But I did love him, and he loved
me, and yet&mdash;he loved others, too. I suffered from jealousy so that&mdash;so
that&mdash;I made myself insufferable. He went into the war&mdash;being an
officer, you know&mdash;and he has never returned. I was told that he had
been killed, but his body was never found, and now I imagine that he
is alive and bound to another woman.&mdash;Think of it! I am still jealous
of my dead husband. At night I see him in my dreams together with that
other woman.... Have you ever known torments like that, Mr. Brunner?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">HUSBAND</span>. You may be sure I have!&mdash;But what makes you think that he is
still alive?</p>

<blockquote>

<p>[<i>He begins to arrange his things in the travelling-bag</i>.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="small-c">BARONESS</span>. A number of circumstances combined to arouse my suspicions at
one time, but for years nothing happened to revive them. Then you came
here four months ago, and, as a strange fate would have it, I noticed
at once a strong resemblance between you and my husband. It served me
as a reminder. And as my dreams took on flesh and blood, so to speak,
my old suspicions turned into certainty, and now I really believe that
he is alive? I am in a constant torment of jealousy&mdash;and that has
enabled me to understand you.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">HUSBAND</span>. [<i>Becoming attentive, after having listened for a while with
apparent indifference</i>] You say that I resemble your husband.&mdash;Won't
you be seated, Baroness?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">BARONESS</span>. [<i>Sits down at the table with her back to the public; the</i>
<span class="small-c">HUSBAND</span> <i>takes a chair beside her</i>] He looked like you, and&mdash;barring
certain weaknesses&mdash;his character also....</p>

<p><span class="small-c">HUSBAND</span>. He was about ten years older than I.... And he had a scar on
his right cheek that looked as if it had been made by a needle....</p>

<p><span class="small-c">BARONESS</span>. That's right!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">HUSBAND</span>. Then I met your husband one night in London.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">BARONESS</span>. Is he alive?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">HUSBAND</span>. I have to figure it out&mdash;for the moment I can't tell.... Let's
see! That was five years ago&mdash;in London, as I told you. I had been to
a party&mdash;men and women&mdash;and the atmosphere had been rather depressed.
On leaving the place, I joined the first man who gave me a chance to
unburden myself. We were <i>en rapport</i> at once, and our chat developed
into one of those endless sidewalk conversations, during which he let
me have his entire history&mdash;having first found out that I came from his
own district.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">BARONESS</span>. Then he is alive?...</p>

<p><span class="small-c">HUSBAND</span>. He was not killed in the war&mdash;that much is certain&mdash;because
he was taken prisoner. Then he fell in love with the mayor's daughter,
ran away with her to England, was deserted by his fair lady, and began
to gamble&mdash;with constant bad luck. When we separated in the morning
hours, he gave me the impression of being doomed. He made me promise
that if chance should ever put you in my way after a year had gone by,
and provided that he had not in the meantime communicated with me by
advertisement in a newspaper I am always reading, I was to consider
him dead. And when I met you, I was to kiss you on the hand, and your
daughter on the brow, saying on his behalf: "Forgive!"</p>

<blockquote>

<p><i>As he kisses the hand of the</i> <span class="small-c">BARONESS</span>, <span class="small-c">ROSE</span> <i>appears on the
veranda, outside the open door, and watches them with evident
excitement</i>.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="small-c">BARONESS</span>. [<i>Agitated</i>] Then he is dead?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">HUSBAND</span>. Yes, and I should have given you his message a little more
promptly, if I had not long ago forgotten the man's name as well as
the man himself. [<i>The</i> <span class="small-c">BARONESS</span> <i>is pulling at her handkerchief,
apparently unable to decide what to say or do</i>] Do you feel better now?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">BARONESS</span>. Yes, in a way, but all hope is gone, too.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">HUSBAND</span>. The hope of suffering those sweet torments again....</p>

<p><span class="small-c">BARONESS</span>. Besides my girl, I had nothing to interest me but my
anxiety.... How strange it is that even suffering can be missed!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">HUSBAND</span>. You'll have to pardon me, but I do think that you miss your
jealousy more than your lost husband.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">BARONESS</span>. Perhaps&mdash;because my jealousy was the invisible tie connecting
me with that image of my dreams.... And now, when I have nothing left
[<i>She takes hold of his hand</i>] You, who have brought me his last
message&mdash;you, who are a living reminder of him, and who have suffered
like me....</p>

<p><span class="small-c">HUSBAND</span>. [<i>Becomes restless, rises and looks at his watch</i>] Pardon me,
but I have to take the next train&mdash;really, I must!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">BARONESS</span>. I was going to ask you not to do so. Why should you go? Don't
you feel at home here?</p>

<blockquote>

<p><span class="small-c">ROSE</span> <i>disappears from the veranda</i>.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="small-c">HUSBAND</span>. Your house has brought me some of the best hours I have
experienced during these stormy years, and I leave you with the
greatest regret&mdash;but I must Baroness. On account of what happened last
night?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">HUSBAND</span>. Not that alone&mdash;it was merely the last straw.... And now I
must pack, if you'll pardon me.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>[<i>He turns his attention to the travelling-bag again</i>.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="small-c">BARONESS</span>. If your decision is irrevocable.... won't you let me help
you, as no one else is doing so?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">HUSBAND</span>. I thank you ever so much, my dear Baroness, but I am almost
done.... And I shall ask you to make our leave-taking less painful by
making it short.... In the midst of all trouble, your tender cares have
been a sweet consolation to me, and I find it almost as painful to
part from you as<i>&mdash;[The</i> <span class="small-c">BARONESS</span> <i>looks deeply moved</i>]&mdash;from a good
mother. I have read compassion in your glances, even when discretion
compelled you to remain silent, and I have thought at times that your
presence tended to improve my domestic happiness&mdash;as your age permitted
you to say things that a younger woman would not like to hear from one
of her own generation....</p>

<p><span class="small-c">BARONESS</span>. [<i>With some hesitation</i>] You must forgive me for saying that
your wife is no longer young....</p>

<p><span class="small-c">HUSBAND</span>. In my eyes she is.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">BARONESS</span>. But not in the eyes of the world.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">HUSBAND</span>. So much the better, although, on the other hand, I find her
coquetry the more disgusting the less her attractions correspond to her
pretensions&mdash;and if a moment comes when they begin to laugh at her....</p>

<p><span class="small-c">BARONESS</span>. They are doing so already.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">HUSBAND</span>. Really? Poor Olga! [<i>He looks thoughtful; then, as a single
stroke of a bell is heard from the church tower outside, he pulls
himself together</i>] The clock struck. I must leave in half an hour.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">BARONESS</span>. But you cannot leave without your breakfast.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">HUSBAND</span>. I am not hungry. As always, when starting on a journey, I am
so excited that my nerves tremble like telephone wires in very cold
weather....</p>

<p><span class="small-c">BARONESS</span>. Then I'll make you a cup of coffee. You'll let me do that,
won't you? And I'll send up the maid to help you pack.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">HUSBAND</span>. Your kindness is so great, Baroness, that I fear being tempted
into weaknesses that I should have to regret later on.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">BARONESS</span>. You would never regret following my advice&mdash;if you only
would! [<i>She goes out</i>.</p>

<blockquote>

<p><i>The</i> <span class="small-c">HUSBAND</span> <i>remains alone for a few moments. Then</i> <span class="small-c">ROSE</span>
<i>enters from the rear</i> with a basketful of roses.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="small-c">HUSBAND</span>. Good morning, Miss Rose. What's the matter?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ROSE</span>. Why?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">HUSBAND</span>. Why.... Because you have your head wrapped up like that.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ROSE</span>. [<i>Tearing off the scarf and hiding it within her dress</i>] There is
nothing the matter with me. I am perfectly well. Are you going away?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">HUSBAND</span>. Yes, I am.</p>

<blockquote>

<p><i>The</i> <span class="small-c">MAID</span> <i>enters</i>.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="small-c">ROSE</span>. What do you want?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">MAID</span>. The Baroness said I should help Mr. Brunner to pack.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ROSE</span>. It isn't necessary. You can go!</p>

<blockquote>

<p><i>The</i> <span class="small-c">MAID</span> <i>hesitates</i>.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="small-c">ROSE</span>. Go, I tell you!</p>

<blockquote>

<p><i>The</i> <span class="small-c">MAID</span> <i>goes out</i>.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="small-c">HUSBAND</span>. Isn't that rather impolite to me, Miss Rose?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ROSE</span>. No, it is not. I wanted to help you myself. But you are impolite
when you run away from your promise to help me with the flowers for
to-morrow's festival. Not that I care a bit&mdash;as I am not going to the
festival to-morrow, because&mdash;I don't know where I may be to-morrow.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">HUSBAND</span>. What does that mean?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ROSE</span>. Can't I help you with something, Mr. Axel? Won't you let me brush
your hat?</p>

<blockquote>

<p>[<i>She picks up his hat and begins to brush it</i>.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="small-c">HUSBAND</span>. No, I can't let you do that, Miss Rose.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>[<i>He tries to take the hat away from her</i>.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="small-c">ROSE</span>. Let me alone! [<i>She puts her fingers into the hole on her sleeve
and tears it open</i>] There, now! You tore my dress!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">HUSBAND</span>. You are so peculiar to-day, Miss Rose, and I think your
restiveness is troubling your mother.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ROSE</span>. Well, what do I care? I am glad if it troubles her, although I
suppose that will hurt <i>you</i>. But I don't care any more for you than
I care for the cat in the kitchen or the rats in the cellar. And if I
were your wife, I should despise you, and go so far away that you could
never find me again!&mdash;You should be ashamed of kissing another woman!
Shame on you!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">HUSBAND</span>. Oh, you saw me kissing your mother's hand, did you? Then
I must tell you that it was nothing but a final greeting from your
father, whom I met abroad after you had seen him for the last time. And
I have a greeting for you, too....</p>

<blockquote>

<p><i>He goes to</i> <span class="small-c">ROSE</span> <i>and puts his hands about her head in order
to kiss her brow, but</i> <span class="small-c">ROSE</span> <i>throws her head back so that
her lips meet his. At that moment the</i> <span class="small-c">WIFE</span> <i>appears on the
veranda, shrinks back at what she sees and disappears again</i>.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="small-c">HUSBAND</span>. My dear child, I meant only to give you an innocent kiss on
the brow.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ROSE</span>. Innocent? Ha-ha! Yes, very innocent!&mdash;And you believe those
fairy-tales mother tells about father, who died several years ago! That
was a man, I tell you, who knew how to love, and who dared to make
love! He didn't tremble at the thought of a kiss, and he didn't wait
until he was asked! If you won't believe me, come with me into the
attic, and I'll let you read the letters he wrote to his mistresses....
Come! [<i>She opens the papered door, so that the stairs leading to the
attic become visible</i>] Ha-ha-ha! You're afraid that I am going to
seduce you, and you look awfully surprised ... surprised because a
girl like me, who has been a woman for three years, knows that there
is nothing innocent about love! Do you imagine that I think children
are born through the ear? Now I can see that you despise me, but you
shouldn't do that, for I am neither worse nor better than anybody
else.... I am like this!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">HUSBAND</span>. Go and change your dress before your mother comes, Miss Rose.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ROSE</span>. Do you think I have such ugly arms? Or don't you dare to look at
them?&mdash;Now I think I know why why your wife why you are so jealous of
your wife!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">HUSBAND</span>. Well, if that isn't the limit!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ROSE</span>. Look at him blush! On my behalf, or on your own? Do you know how
many times I have been in love?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">HUSBAND</span>. Never!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ROSE</span>. Never with a bashful fellow like you!&mdash;Tell me, does that make
you despise me again?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">HUSBAND</span>. A little!&mdash;Take care of your heart, and don't put it where the
birds can pick at it, and where it gets&mdash;dirty. You call yourself a
woman, but you are a very young woman&mdash;a girl, in other words....</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ROSE</span>. And for that reason just for that reason.... But I can become a
woman....</p>

<p><span class="small-c">HUSBAND</span>. Until you have&mdash;I think we had better postpone conversations
of this kind. Shake hands on that, Miss Rose!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ROSE</span>. [<i>With tears of anger</i>] Never! Never! Oh, you!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">HUSBAND</span>. Are we not going to part as friends&mdash;we who have had so many
pleasant days together during the gloomy winter and the slow spring?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">WIFE</span>. [<i>Enters, carrying a tray with the coffee things on it; she seems
embarrassed and pretends not to notice</i> <span class="small-c">ROSE</span>] I thought you might have
time to drink a nice cup of coffee before you leave. [<span class="small-c">ROSE</span> <i>tries to
take the tray away from her</i>] No, my little girl, I can attend to this
myself.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">HUSBAND</span>. [<i>Watching his wife in a questioning and somewhat ironic
manner</i>] That was an excellent idea of yours....</p>

<p><span class="small-c">WIFE</span>. [<i>Evading his glance</i>] I am glad ... that....</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ROSE</span>. Perhaps I had better say good-bye now&mdash;to Mr. Brunner....</p>

<p><span class="small-c">HUSBAND</span>. So you mean to desert me now, Miss Rose....</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ROSE</span>. I suppose I must ... because ... your wife is angry with me.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">WIFE</span>. I? Why in the world....</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ROSE</span>. You promised to try on my dress....</p>

<p><span class="small-c">WIFE</span>. Not at this time, child. You can see that I have other things to
do now. Or perhaps you wish to keep my husband company while I get the
dress ready?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">HUSBAND</span>. Olga!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">WIFE</span>. What is it?</p>

<blockquote>

<p><span class="small-c">ROSE</span> <i>puts her fingers into her mouth, looking at once
embarrassed and angry</i>.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="small-c">WIFE</span>. You had better dress decently, my dear young lady, if you are to
go with us to the train.</p>

<blockquote>

<p><span class="small-c">ROSE</span> <i>remains as before</i>.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="small-c">WIFE</span>. And suppose you take your flowers with you, if there is to be any
demonstration....</p>

<p><span class="small-c">HUSBAND</span>. That's cruel, Olga!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ROSE</span>. [<i>Dropping a curtsey</i>] Good-bye, Mr. Brunner.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">HUSBAND</span>. [<i>Shaking hands with her</i>] Good-bye, Miss Rose. I hope you
will be happy, and that you will be a big girl soon-a very big girl.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ROSE</span>. [<i>Picking up her flowers</i>] Good-bye, Mrs. Brunner. [<i>As she gets
no answer</i>] Good-bye! [<i>She runs out</i>.</p>

<blockquote>

<p><span class="small-c">HUSBAND</span> <i>and</i> <span class="small-c">WIFE</span> <i>look equally embarrassed; she tries to
avoid looking him in the face</i>.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="small-c">WIFE</span>. Can I be of any help?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">HUSBAND</span>. No, thank you, I am practically done.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">WIFE</span>. And there are so many others to help you.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">HUSBAND</span>. Let me have a look at you!</p>

<blockquote>

<p>[<i>He tries to take hold of her head</i>.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="small-c">WIFE</span>. [<i>Escaping him</i>] No, leave me alone.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">HUSBAND</span>. What is it?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">WIFE</span>. Perhaps you think that I am&mdash;that I am jealous?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">HUSBAND</span>. I think so when you say it, but I could never have believed it
before.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">WIFE</span>. Of a schoolgirl like that&mdash;ugh!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">HUSBAND</span>. The character of the object seems immaterial in cases of this
kind. I felt jealous of a hired man You saw, then, that....</p>

<p><span class="small-c">WIFE</span>. That you kissed her!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">HUSBAND</span>. No, it was she who kissed me.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">WIFE</span>. How shameless! But minxes like her are regular apes!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">HUSBAND</span>. Yes, they take after the grown-up people.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">WIFE</span>. You seem to be pleased by her attentions anyhow.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">HUSBAND</span>. Little used as I am to such attentions....</p>

<p><span class="small-c">WIFE</span>. On the part of young ladies, perhaps&mdash;but you seem less timid
with the old ones....</p>

<p><span class="small-c">HUSBAND</span>. You saw that, too, did you?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">WIFE</span>. No, but Rose told me. Apparently you are quite a lady-killer.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">HUSBAND</span>. So it seems. It's too bad that I can't profit by it.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">WIFE</span>. You'll soon be free to choose a younger and prettier wife.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">HUSBAND</span>. I am not aware of any such freedom.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">WIFE</span>. Now when I am old and ugly!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">HUSBAND</span>. I can't make out what has happened. Let me have another look
at you. [<i>He comes close to her</i>.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">WIFE</span>. [<i>Hiding her face at his bosom</i>] You mustn't look at me!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">HUSBAND</span>. What in the world does this mean? You are not jealous of a
little schoolgirl or an old widow....</p>

<p><span class="small-c">WIFE</span>. I have broken&mdash;one of my front teeth. Please don't look at me!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">HUSBAND</span>. Oh, you child!&mdash;With pain comes the first tooth, and with pain
the first one goes.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">WIFE</span>. And now you'll leave me, of course?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">HUSBAND</span>. Not on your life! [<i>Closing the bag with a snap</i>] To-morrow
we'll start for Augsburg to get you a new tooth of gold.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">WIFE</span>. But we'll never come back here.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">HUSBAND</span>. Not if you say so.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">WIFE</span>. And now your fears are gone?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">HUSBAND</span>. Yes&mdash;for another week.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">BARONESS</span>. [<i>Enters carrying a tray; looks very embarrassed at seeing
them together</i>] Excuse me, but I thought....</p>

<p><span class="small-c">HUSBAND</span>. Thank you, Baroness, I have had coffee already, but for your
sake I'll have another cup. And if you&mdash;[<span class="small-c">ROSE</span>, <i>dressed in white,
appears in the doorway at that moment</i>] and Miss Rose care to keep us
company, we have no objection. On the contrary, nothing could please
us better, as my wife and I are leaving on the first train to-morrow
morning.</p>

<h3>ACT I</h3>

<hr class="r5" />
<blockquote>

<p><i>The main living-room in</i> <span class="small-c">MONS NILSSON'S</span> <i>house at Copperberg
(which is the old name of the present city of Falun in
Dalecarlia</i>).</p>

<p><i>There is a door in the rear, with a window on either side,
through which are visible small city houses with snow-covered
roofs and the flames belching from many blast-furnaces. A large
open fireplace with mantelpiece occupies the center of the
right wall. A fine log fire is going in the fireplace. On the
same side, nearer the footlights, is a door</i>.</p>

<p><i>A long tablefills the middle of the floor. At its farther
end stands an armchair with cushions on the seat and bright
textiles draped over the back and the arm supports. Wooden
benches run along the two long sides of the table</i>.</p>

<p><i>Wooden seats are placed along the left wall</i>.</p>

<p><i>Above the wainscotting of the walls appear large, simple
frescoes depicting the adventures of</i> <span class="small-c">GUSTAVUS VASA</span> <i>in
Dalecarlia (at the beginning of the war of liberation). The one
at the left of the rear door shows him at the home of Master
John at Svärdsjö; the one at the right pictures him threshing
in the barn of</i> <span class="small-c">ANDERS PERSSON OF RANKHYTTAN</span> <i>(while Danish
soldiers are searching the place for him)</i>.</p>

<p><i>The ringing of a church-bell is heard from the outside as the
curtain rises</i>.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">MONS NILSSON</span> <i>is seated at the table, writing. His</i> <span class="small-c">WIFE</span> <i>is
arranging tankards and beakers of silver on the mantelshelf</i>.</p></blockquote>


<p><span class="small-c">MONS</span>. That's four o'clock, is it not?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">WIFE</span>. Of course.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">MONS</span>. Sounds like fire.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">WIFE</span>. Is that any special sound?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">MONS</span>. Yes, it sounds like "help-help, help-help!"</p>

<p><span class="small-c">WIFE</span>. That's the way it has sounded ever since the King carried off our
bells, it seems to me.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">MONS</span>. Be quiet! And don't talk behind anybody's back. The King will
soon be here himself.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">WIFE</span>. Has the King sent word of his visit, as you have put everything
in order to receive him?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">MONS</span>. Not exactly, but when he sends word that he is coming to
Copperberg, it is not to be expected that he will pass by his friend
Mons Nilsson, who helped him in the days of trial, and who has stood by
him both against Master Knut and Peder the Chancellor, not to speak of
the False Sture.<a name="FNanchor_1_10" id="FNanchor_1_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_10" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> And he acted as godfather for my girl besides.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">WIFE</span>. That was a good while ago; but when the King's bailiff came here
to get the bells two years ago, you helped to kill him.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">MONS</span>. That was two years ago, and I guess he was set on having our
heads at that time. But just then King Christian broke into the country
from Norway. Our own King turned meek as a lamb at once, and when he
asked us for help, we Dalecarlians stood by him like one man, and gave
him all the help he wanted. So I think we can call it even.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">WIFE</span>. So <i>you</i> think, but the King never calls it even except when it
is to his own advantage.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">MONS</span>. Perhaps not. But as long as Christian still is free, he will not
dare to break with us.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">WIFE</span>. Well, is Christian still free?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">MONS</span>. I have heard nothing to the contrary. Anyhow, the King owes us
such a lot of money that, leaving old friendship aside....</p>

<p><span class="small-c">WIFE</span>. God bless you! And I hope He will protect you from the friend
that is always breaking his word and safe-conduct!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">MONS</span>. Don't open the old wounds, but let bygones be bygones.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">WIFE</span>. If you do that, and he won't, you can hardly call it a
reconciliation. Take care!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">MONS</span>. The sound of that bell is really dreadful!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">WIFE</span>. So it is to my ears, because it always reminds me of the big
Mary, which the bailiff took away. Do you remember when the Mary was
cast out of the best refined copper and the whole town brought milk and
cream to give the clay of the form more firmness&mdash;and then, when the
melt was ready, we threw in one-half of our table silver to improve the
tone? It was baptised at Candlemas and rung for the first time at the
burial of my father.... And then it went to Herman Israel at Luebeck,
who made coin out of it.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">MONS</span>. All that is perfectly true, but now it <i>must</i> be forgotten&mdash;or we
shall never have peace.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">BARBRO</span>, <i>their daughter, enters with a basket full of finely chopped
spruce branches; she is dressed in black and white, and so are several
younger children who follow her, also carrying baskets. All of them
begin to spread the chopped spruce over the floor</i>.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">WIFE</span>. [<i>To</i> <span class="small-c">MONS</span>] Is there to be a funeral?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">MONS</span>. No, but not being the season, we couldn't get any leaves.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">WIFE</span>. I think the children might put off their mourning at least.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">MONS</span>. No, that's just what they should not do, because when the King
asks whom they are mourning&mdash;well, what are you to answer, Barbro?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">BARBRO</span>. "We mourn our beloved teacher, Pastor John at Svärdsjö."</p>

<p><span class="small-c">MONS</span>. And what are you to say, if the King asks you why?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">BARBRO</span>. "Because he was an early friend of King Gustavus and saved his
precious life for our country."</p>

<p><span class="small-c">MONS</span>. What year was that?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">BARBRO</span>. "The very year when Christian the Tyrant cut the head off the
Swedish nobility."<a name="FNanchor_2_11" id="FNanchor_2_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_11" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>

<p><span class="small-c">MONS</span>. That's right, children. And over there you see the picture of
Master John when he is holding the towel for the outlaw who has been
threshing in the barn. [<i>To his</i> <span class="small-c">WIFE</span>] On the other hand, it is not
necessary to tell the children that the King took his friend's head two
years ago.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">WIFE</span>. Have you really that much sense left?&mdash;Do you think the King
likes any reminder of a deed that has brought him so little honour?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">MONS</span>. Let him like it or dislike it, he'll have to swallow it. It was
an ugly deed, and Master John was a saint and a martyr, who died for
his faith&mdash;the faith of his childhood, which he would not forswear.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">BARBRO</span>. [<i>Standing by the armchair at the end of the table</i>] Is the
King to sit here?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">MONS</span>. Yes, child, that's where the marvellous man of God is to sit
when he visits his friend Mons Nilsson of Aspeboda. His whole life is
like a miracle story, children: how the Lord guided him out of a Danish
prison up to Dalecarlia, and how, after many hardships, he finally
freed his country from oppression. Those pictures on the walls tell you
the whole story, down to the moment when the ski-runner overtook him at
Sälen, close by the Norwegian border-line.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">BARBRO</span>. [<i>Looking at the picture just indicated</i>] Is it true, father,
that the ski-runner was named Engelbrecht, like the great chieftain we
had in the past century?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">MONS</span>. Yes, it's true, child, and we used to speak of it as "the finger
of God," but now we call it mere superstition.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">WIFE</span>. Don't put that sort of thing into the children's heads!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">MONS</span>. Oh, keep quiet! I teach the children nothing but what is right
and proper.&mdash;And bear in mind, little girls, that, no matter what you
may hear, you must never believe or say anything bad of the King. Earth
bears no heavier burden than a thankless man. And for that reason you
must sing the ballad of King Gustav when he comes here. Do you still
remember it?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">BARBRO</span>. Oh, yes!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">MONS</span>. Let me hear you read it then.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">BARBRO</span>. [<i>Reciting</i>],</p>

<p><span class="small-c">MONS</span>. That I should take your advice. So I have done in the past, and
it has ended badly every time.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">WIFE</span>. Try it once more!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">MONS</span>. So we are.&mdash;And where's the King?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ANDERS</span>. The other side of the hill, says the ski-runner that just
returned.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">MONS</span>. As near as that?&mdash;And what errand is supposed to bring him here?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ANDERS</span>. Ask Nils of Söderby.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">NILS</span>. They say he is headed for Norway to fight Christian.</p>

<p>Inghel. There are others who think that he is coming to thank us
Dalecarlians for the good help rendered in his last fight.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">STIG</span>. That would not be like him.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ANDERS</span>. To thank anybody&mdash;no, indeed!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">MONS</span>. Do you think there is any cause for fear?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">NILS</span>. Not while Christian is still free.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">INGHEL</span>. It's queer that we should have to look to Christian for safety.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">STIG</span>. We knew what we had, but not what we might get. Christian took
the heads of the noble lords and left the people alone. This one leaves
the lords alone and rides roughshod over the people. Who should be
called a tyrant?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">MONS</span>. Be quiet now!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ANDERS</span>. In other words, the last war of liberation was fought <i>against</i>
our liberator. Did we know at all what we were doing at that time?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">INGHEL</span>. We were to clear the country of the Danes; and the first man to
raise his hand for the King against the Danes in our parts was Rasmus
Dane, who killed Nils Westgoth. That was a strange beginning....</p>

<p><span class="small-c">NILS</span>. A strange beginning, indeed, but just like the ending. [<i>To</i>

<blockquote>

<p><i>She turns and looks inquiringly at him</i>.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="small-c">NILS</span>. The King is coming.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">MONS</span>. In the name of the Lord, be quiet! That kind of talk will bring
no peace.&mdash;All that you say is true, of course, but what has happened
was the will of Providence&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="small-c">STIG</span>. Which let the children have their will in order that they should
see their own folly.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ANDERS</span>. Are you quite sure that the King will visit you, Mons Nilsson?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">MONS</span>. What a question!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ANDERS</span>. Remember Master John!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">MONS</span>. Let us forget! Everything must be forgotten.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ANDERS</span>. No wonder if you and <span class="small-c">NILS</span> want to forget that you burned the
King's house at Hedemora and looted Räfvelstad two years ago! But <i>he</i>
will never forget it.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">OLAVUS</span>. With your leave, this is the message our gracious lord, the

Copperberg, and let every man stay in his own house." If he desires
speech with any one, that one will be called.</p>

There is something you should know, Master Stig. How was it during the

<p><span class="small-c">OLAVUS</span>. [<i>To</i> <span class="small-c">ANDERS</span>] Was there not enough of it?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">STIG</span>. There are no bad priests here, and nothing but the pure word of
God is preached!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">OLAVUS</span>. That's the best thing I have heard yet! Nothing but the pure
word of God, you say! [<i>Pause</i>] Nils intimated a while ago that
fourteen thousand men will take up arms when you ring the big bell at
Mora. That was mere boasting, I suppose?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">MONS</span>. Oh, if you ring it the right way, I think sixteen thousand will
come. What do you say, Anders Persson?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ANDERS</span>. Sixteen, you say? I should say eighteen!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">OLAVUS</span>. Fine! Then we shall ring it the right way when the Dane comes
next time. Only seven thousand answered the last call&mdash;to fight the

<p><span class="small-c">MONS</span>. [<i>Leaping to his feet</i>] Treachery!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">OLAVUS</span>. Exactly: treachery and traitors!&mdash;If you don't go at once,
Master Stig, you'll ride bareback!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">STIG</span>. To hell!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">OLAVUS</span>. Yes, <i>to</i> hell!&mdash;Away!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">MONS</span> <i>and</i> <span class="small-c">ANDERS</span> <i>rise and start for the door</i>.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="small-c">MONS</span>. Do you know who I am&mdash;that I am a free miner and a friend of the
King?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">OLAVUS</span>. Be seated then, and keep your peace. If you are a friend of
the King, there has been a mistake. Sit down, Anders Persson and Mons
Nilsson! No harm will befall you or anybody else who is innocent.
Let Master Stig go, and don't get excited. Where does the thought of
violence come from, if not from your own bad conscience?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">STIG</span>. That's true. We have done nothing wrong, and no one has
threatened us.&mdash;Be quiet, friends. I shall soon be back. [<i>He goes out</i>.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">MONS</span>. That's right!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">OLAVUS</span>. Throw a stick at the pack, and the one that is hit will yelp.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ANDERS</span>. [<i>To</i> <span class="small-c">MONS</span>] That was stupid of us! Let us keep calm! [<i>Aloud</i>]
You see, doctor, one gets suspicious as one grows old, particularly
after having seen so many broken words and promises....</p>

<p><span class="small-c">OLAVUS</span>. I understand. In these days, when people change masters as
the snake changes its skin, a certain instability of mind is easily
produced. In young men it may be pardonable, but it is absolutely
unpardonable in old and experienced persons.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">MONS</span>. As far as age is concerned, there is nothing to say about the
King, who still is in his best years....</p>

<p><span class="small-c">OLAVUS</span>. And for that reason pardonable....</p>

<p><span class="small-c">MONS</span>. [<i>To</i> <span class="small-c">ANDERS</span>] I think he must be the devil himself!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ANDERS</span>. [<i>To</i> <span class="small-c">OLAVUS</span>] How long are we to wait here? And what are we to
wait for?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">OLAVUS</span>. The King's commands, as you ought to know.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">MONS</span>. Are we regarded as prisoners, then?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">OLAVUS</span>. By no means, but it is not wise to venture out for a while yet.</p>

<blockquote>

<p><span class="small-c">MONS</span> <i>and</i> <span class="small-c">ANDERS</span> <i>move from one chair to another and give
other evidence of agitation</i>.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="small-c">MONS</span>. Some great evil is afoot. I can feel it within me.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ANDERS</span>. It must be very hot in here.... I am sweating. Would you like a
glass of beer, doctor?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">OLAVUS</span>. No, thank you.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ANDERS</span>. Or a glass of wine?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">OLAVUS</span>. Not for me, thanks!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">MONS</span>. But it's real hock.</p>

<blockquote>

<p><span class="small-c">MASTER OLAVUS</span> <i>shakes his head. At that moment drum-beats are
heard outside</i>.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="small-c">ANDERS</span>. [<i>Beyond himself</i>] In the name of Christ, will this never come
to an end?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">OLAVUS</span>. [<i>Rising</i>] Yes, this is the end!</p>

<blockquote>

<p><i>He goes to the door and opens it</i>.</p>

<p><i>The</i> <span class="small-c">MESSENGER</span> <i>enters and throws on the table the
bloodstained coats of</i> <span class="small-c">INGHEL HANSSON</span>, <span class="small-c">NILS OF SÖDERBY</span>, <i>and</i>
<span class="small-c">MASTER STIG</span>.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="small-c">OLAVUS</span>. Look!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">MONS</span> <i>and</i> <span class="small-c">ANDERS</span>. Another blood-bath!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">MONS</span>. Without trial or hearing!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">OLAVUS</span>. The trial took place two years age, and sentence was passed.
But the King put mercy above justice and let the traitors remain
at large to see whether their repentance was seriously meant. When
he learned that they remained incorrigible and went on with their
rebellious talk as before, he decided to execute the sentences. That's
how the matter looks when presented truthfully.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">MONS</span>. And yet there was a lot of talk about everything being forgiven
and forgotten....</p>

<p><span class="small-c">OLAVUS</span>. So it was, provided the same offence was not repeated. But it
was repeated, and what might have been forgotten was again remembered.
All that is clear as logic. [<i>To</i> <span class="small-c">HERMAN ISRAEL</span>] These two trustworthy
men.... [<i>To</i> <span class="small-c">MONS</span> <i>and</i> <span class="small-c">ANDERS</span>] You are trustworthy, are you not?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">MONS</span> <i>and</i> <span class="small-c">ANDERS</span>. Hope so!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">OLAVUS</span>. Answer yes or no! Are you trustworthy?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">MONS</span> <i>and</i> <span class="small-c">ANDERS</span>. Yes!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">OLAVUS</span>. [<i>To</i> <span class="small-c">ISRAEL</span>] In the presence of you as my witness, syndic,
these two trustworthy men have given a true report of conditions in
Dalecarlia. They have unanimously assured us that the mines are being
worked profitably; that agriculture and cattle-breeding prosper no
less than the mining; that famines occur but rarely, and that, during
the last one, our gracious King distributed grain in quantities not
insufficient, which went to those that really were in need. These
trustworthy and upright miners have also confirmed the following
facts: that bells to summon the congregations still remain in all the
churches; that no bad priests are spreading devices of men, and that
nothing is preached here but the pure word of God. You have likewise
heard them say, syndic, that the province of Dalecarlia can raise from
sixteen to eighteen thousand men capable of bearing arms&mdash;the figures
vary as their courage falls or rises. Being in charge of the current
debt, and for that reason entitled to know the actual <i>status</i> of the
country, you have now heard the people declare with their own lips,
that all the Dalecarlian grievances are unwarranted, and that those who
have spread reports to the contrary are traitors and liars.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">MONS</span>. <i>Veto!</i></p>

<p><span class="small-c">ANDERS</span>. I deny it!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">OLAVUS</span>. If you deny your own words, then you are liars twice over!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">MONS</span>. He is drawing the noose tighter! Better keep silent!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ANDERS</span>. No, I most speak. [<i>To</i> <span class="small-c">OLAVUS</span>] I want to know what our fate is
to be.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">OLAVUS</span>. So you shall. Your fate is in your own hands. You are invited
to Stockholm and given full safe-conduct. You can travel freely by
yourselves. This is granted you as old friends of the King, to whom he
acknowledges a great debt of gratitude.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">MONS</span>. More guile!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">OLAVUS</span>. No guile at all. Here is the King's safe-conduct, signed by his
own hand.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ANDERS</span>. We know all about his safe-conducts!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">MONS</span>. [<i>To</i> <span class="small-c">ANDERS</span>] We must consent and submit in order to gain time!
[<i>To</i> <span class="small-c">OLAVUS</span>] Will you let us go into the next room and talk the matter
over?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">OLAVUS</span>. You can now go wherever you want&mdash;except to the King.</p>

<blockquote>

<p><span class="small-c">MONS</span> <i>and</i> <span class="small-c">ANDERS</span> <i>go toward the left</i>.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="small-c">MONS</span>. [<i>As he opens the door</i>] We'll bring you an answer shortly.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">OLAVUS</span>. As you please, and when you please.</p>

<blockquote>

<p><span class="small-c">MONS</span> <i>and</i> <span class="small-c">ANDERS</span> <i>go out</i>.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="small-c">OLAVUS</span>. [<i>To</i> <span class="small-c">ISRAEL</span>] A stiff-necked people, true as gold, but full of
distrust.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ISRAEL</span>. A very fine people.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">OLAVUS</span>. Rather stupid, however. Did you notice how I trapped them?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ISRAEL</span>. That was good work. How did you learn to do it?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">OLAVUS</span>. By long observation of innumerable human beings I have been led
to conclude at last that vanity the primal sin and mother of all the
vices. To get the truth out of criminals, I have merely to set them
boasting.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ISRAEL</span>. What wisdom! What wisdom! And you are not yet an old man!&mdash;But
there are modest people, too, and out of these you cannot get the
truth, according to what you have just said.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">OLAVUS</span>. Modest people boast of their modesty, so that is all one.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ISRAEL</span>. [<i>Looking attentively at him</i>] If you'll pardon me&mdash;Master
Olavus was your name, I think? You cannot be Olavus Petri?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">OLAVUS</span>. I am.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ISRAEL</span>. [<i>Surprised</i>] Who carried out the Reformation?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">OLAVUS</span>. I am that man.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ISRAEL</span>. And who was subsequently tried for high treason on suspicion of
having known about a plot against the King's life?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">OLAVUS</span>. Confidences given me under the seal of confession, so that I
had no right to betray them.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ISRAEL</span>. [<i>Gazing curiously at</i> <span class="small-c">OLAVUS</span>] Hm-hm! [<i>Pause</i>] A mysterious
story it was, nevertheless.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">OLAVUS</span>. No, I don't think so. Gorius Holst and Hans Bökman were found
guilty. And it was so little of a secret, that the people of Hamburg
heard of the King's murder as an accomplished fact long before the plot
was exposed at Stockholm.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ISRAEL</span>. That is just what I call mysterious, especially as we knew
nothing about it at Luebeck.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">OLAVUS</span>. Yes, I call that mysterious, too, because the road to Hamburg
goes through Luebeck as a rule. [<span class="small-c">ISRAEL</span> <i>makes no reply</i>] And it was
rumoured at the time, that Marcus Meyer and Juerghen Wollenweber were
no strangers to the plot.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ISRAEL</span>. I have never heard of it, and I don't believe it. [<i>Pause;
then, pointing to the blood-stained coats</i>] Must those things stay here?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">OLAVUS</span>. Yes, for the present.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ISRAEL</span>. It seems to me that these royal visits are rather sanguinary
affairs.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">OLAVUS</span>. I don't allow myself to pass judgment on the actions of my
King, partly because I am not capable of doing so, and partly because I
know there is a judge above too, who guides his destiny.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ISRAEL</span>. That is beautifully said and thought. Have you always been
equally wise?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">OLAVUS</span>. No, but what you have not been you frequently become. [<i>Pause</i>.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ISRAEL</span>. Won't those people in there try to get away?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">OLAVUS</span>. That, too, has been foreseen, just as their desire to discuss
the matter had been reckoned with. Do you know what they are talking of?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ISRAEL</span>. No, I have not the slightest idea.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">OLAVUS</span>. They still imagine that King Christian is free, and they are
planning to seek help from him.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ISRAEL</span>. What a senseless thought!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">OLAVUS</span>. Especially as Christian is a prisoner.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ISRAEL</span>. It sounds like madness, but when you hear how devoted these
good men of the mining districts are to their King, it cannot surprise
you that they may have in mind the oath binding them to their only
lawful sovereign....</p>

<p><span class="small-c">OLAVUS</span>. Now, with your pardon, I <i>am</i> surprised....</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ISRAEL</span>. Oh, mercy, I am merely putting myself in their place.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">OLAVUS</span>. It is always dangerous to put oneself in the place of traitors.
[<i>Pause</i>.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">BARBRO</span>. [<i>Entering from the right, followed by the smaller children</i>]
Is father here? [<i>She looks around and discovers</i> <span class="small-c">ISRAEL</span> <i>seated in the
armchair prepared for the King</i>] Goodness, here is the King!</p>

<blockquote>

<p>[<i>She kneels, the other children following her example</i>.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="small-c">ISRAEL</span>. No, no, dear children, I am not the King. I am only a poor
merchant from Luebeck.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">OLAVUS</span>. A noble answer! [<i>To the children</i>] This is Herman Israel, the
far-famed and influential councillor, who, with Cord König and Nils
Bröms, saved our King out of Danish captivity and enabled him to carry
out the war of liberation. You will find him on the picture in Saint
Jorghen's Gildhall which represents Gustavus Vasa appearing before the
City Council of Luebeck. Honour to the man who has honour deserved.
Give homage to the friend of your country and your King.</p>

<blockquote>

<p><span class="small-c">BARBRO</span> <i>and the</i> <span class="small-c">CHILDREN</span> <i>clap their hands</i>.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="small-c">ISRAEL</span>. [<i>Rises, evidently touched</i>] My dear little friends.... All I
can do is to thank you.... I have really not deserved this.... You see,
a merchant does nothing except for payment, and I have been richly paid.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">OLAVUS</span>. Don't believe him! But bear in mind that there are services
that can never be paid, and beautiful deeds that can never be wiped out
by ingratitude or forgetfulness.&mdash;Go back to your own room now. Your
father will come in a moment.</p>

<blockquote>

<p><span class="small-c">BARBRO</span> <i>and the</i> <span class="small-c">CHILDREN</span> <i>go out to the right</i>.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="small-c">ISRAEL</span>. I had never expected such a thing of you, doctor.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">OLAVUS</span>. I think I understand why. However, my dear syndic, don't ever
compel us to become ungrateful. Ingratitude is such a heavy burden to
carry.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ISRAEL</span>. What is the use of talking of it? There is nothing of that kind
to be feared.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">MONS NILSSON</span> <i>and</i> <span class="small-c">ANDERS PERSSON</span> <i>enter from the left</i>.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="small-c">MONS</span>. After talking it over, we have decided to go to Stockholm with
the King's good word and safe-conduct, so that we can quietly discuss
the matter with him and the lords of the realm.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">OLAVUS</span>. Then my errand here is done, and both of us can leave. I wish
you, Mons Nilsson, and you, Anders Persson, welcome to the capital.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">MONS</span>. Thank you, doctor.</p>

<blockquote>

<p><span class="small-c">MASTER OLAVUS</span> <i>and</i> <span class="small-c">HERMAN ISRAEL</span> <i>go out</i>.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="small-c">MONS</span>. [<i>Picking up the bloodstained coats as soon as they are out of
sight</i>] These shall be our blood-stained banners! King Christian will
furnish the staffs, and then&mdash;on to Stockholm!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ANDERS</span>. And down with it!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">OLAVUS</span>. [<i>Returning unexpectedly</i>] There was one thing I forgot to tell
you. Do you hear?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ANDERS</span>. [<i>Angrily</i>] Well!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">OLAVUS</span>. King Christian has been captured and made a prisoner at
Sonderborg Castle, in the island of Als.</p>

<blockquote>

archdeacon, Master Knut, both members of the old Catholic clergy, tried
to raise the Dalecarlians against the King in 1524-5, when his hold
on the new throne was still very precarious. The False Sture was a
young Dalecarlian named John Hansson, who had acquired gentle manners
as a servant in noble houses and who posed as the natural son of Sten
Sture the Younger, "National Director" of Sweden until 1520. This
pretender, who headed another Dalecarlian uprising in 1527, figures
also in Ibsen's early historical drama, "Lady Inger." The taking of the
church-bells mentioned by Mons Nilsson's wife took place in 1531 and
resulted in the killing of several of the King's representatives by the
Dalecarlians.</p></div>

<p><a name="Footnote_2_11" id="Footnote_2_11"></a><a href="#FNanchor_2_11"><span class="label">[2]</span></a> In 1520 Christian II of Denmark made a temporarily
successful effort to bring Sweden back into the union with the other
two Scandinavian kingdoms. Having defeated the Swedish "National
Director," Sten Sture the Younger, and been admitted to the city of
Stockholm, he caused about eighty of the most influential members of
the Swedish nobility to be beheaded in a single day. That was the
"Blood-bath of Stockholm," by which King Gustavus lost his father
and brother-in-law. On the same occasion his mother and sister were
imprisoned, and both died before they could be set free.</p></div>

border of Dalecarlia. Brunbeck Ferry or Ford was for centuries the
main crossing point of the Dal River for all who entered the province
of Dalecarlia from the south. Rendered arrogant by the part they
had played in the wars of liberation between 1434 and 1524, the
Dalecarlians had established a claim that not even the King himself had
the right to pass those two border points at the head of an armed force
without first having obtained their permission.</p></div>

<p style="text-align: center;">FIRST SCENE</p>


<blockquote>

<p><i>The office of</i> <span class="small-c">HERMAN ISRAEL</span>. <i>A large room, the walls of
which are covered by cupboards. Door in the rear; doors in both
side walls; few windows, and these very small. A fireplace on
the left-hand side. A large table in the middle of the floor;
armchairs about it. Above the rear door and the fireplace
appears the coat of arms of Luebeck, in black, red, and silver</i>.</p>

<p><i>At the right, a desk with writing material and a pair of
scales. The room contains also several sets of shelves filled
with goods in bundles</i>.</p>

<p><i>One of the cupboard doors stands open, disclosing a number of
altar vessels of gold and silver</i>.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">MARCUS</span> <i>is weighing some of the vessels at the desk, while</i>
<span class="small-c">DAVID</span> <i>is noting down the weights given him</i>.</p></blockquote>


<p><span class="small-c">MARCUS</span>. A crucifix of silver, gilded; weighs twelve ounces.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">DAVID</span>. [<i>Writing</i>] Twelve ounces....</p>

<p><span class="small-c">MARCUS</span>. Item: a monstrance of gold&mdash;a perfect thumper. Weighs.... Let
me see now.... Oh, it's hollow&mdash;and the base is filled with lead....
Put down a question-mark.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">DAVID</span>. Question-mark it is.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">MARCUS</span>. A paten of silver&mdash;well, I don't know. [<i>He tests the vessel
with his teeth</i>] It tastes like copper at least. Put it down as "white
metallic substance."</p>

<p><span class="small-c">DAVID</span>. White metallic substance.&mdash;Do you think those rustics are
cheating us?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">MARCUS</span>. Us? Nobody can cheat us!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">DAVID</span>. Don't be too certain. Niegels Bröms, the goldsmith, says that
interlopers from Holland are going through the country selling church
vessels full of coggery, probably meant to be exchanged for the genuine
goods.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">MARCUS</span>. We'll have to get it back on the bells, which contain a lot of
silver, according to old traditions.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">DAVID</span>. The bells&mdash;yes, they were to go to Luebeck, but instead they are
going to the royal gun-foundry to be cast into culverins and bombards.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">MARCUS</span>. So it is said. If only the Dalecarlians knew of it, they would
come galloping across the border forests, I suppose.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">DAVID</span>. I think their galloping came to an end with the recent fall
slaughter.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">MARCUS</span>. No, there will be no end to it while the two blackest rogues
are still at leisure....</p>

<p><span class="small-c">DAVID</span>. You mean Mons Nilsson of Aspeboda and Anders Persson of
Rankhyttan, who are still hanging about the town, hoping to get an
audience with the King?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">MARCUS</span>. Those are the ones.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">DAVID</span>. Calling them rogues is rather an exaggeration, and our Principal
seems to put great store on them.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">MARCUS</span>. Now, David, don't forget the first and last duty of a Hanseatic
clerk&mdash;which is to keep his mouth closed. And bear in mind the
number of talkative young fellows who have vanished for ever through
water-gates and cellar holes. You had better remember!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">DAVID</span>. I'll try, although it seems about time for the Hansa itself to
be thinking of the great silence. [<i>Pause</i>.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">MARCUS</span>. Do you know where the Principal is?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">DAVID</span>. With the King, I suppose, taking an inventory of Eskil's
Chamber.<a name="FNanchor_1_13" id="FNanchor_1_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_13" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

<p><span class="small-c">MARCUS</span>. No, he is not. I think the Principal is with the King.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">JACOB</span>. Then I'll sit down here and wait. Go on with your writing. I
won't disturb you.</p>

leave me, Jacob?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">JACOB</span>. I was tired of playing.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ERIC</span>. I don't think that was the reason. Some one offended you&mdash;some
one who is not my friend.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">JACOB</span>. No one has offended me, Prince, but I have such a strong feeling
that I ought not to appear at court.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ERIC</span>. Oh, Jacob, my friend, why do you cease to call your old
schoolmate by name? And why do you look at me like a stranger? Give
me your hand You won't? And I, who have been lonely and deserted ever
since my mother died; who am hated by my stepmother, by my father, and
by my half-brother; I am begging for the friendship which you gave me
once and which you are now taking back.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">JACOB</span>. I am not taking back anything, Eric, but we are not allowed
to be friends. The fact that we two, as mere boys, formed ties of
friendship that were nursed by common sufferings, has been ignored or
tolerated by our fathers so far. Now, when you are about to marry a
foreign princess and take possession of a duchy, it has been deemed
politic to separate us.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ERIC</span>. Your words are stilted, as if you meant to hide your own
thoughts, but your feelings are not to be concealed....</p>

<p><span class="small-c">JACOB</span>. Pardon me, Eric, but this is not the place for a conversation
like this....</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ERIC</span>. Because this is a place for trading, you mean&mdash;as if the parties
to such a transaction were degraded by it? I don't object to it,
although I am rather inclined to think the seller more broad-minded
than the buyer.</p>

<blockquote>

<p><span class="small-c">JACOB</span> <i>indicates by a gesture the presence of the two clerks</i>.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="small-c">ERIC</span>. Oh, let them hear. Marcus and I are old friends, and we met at
the Blue Dove last night.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">JACOB</span>. Ugh! Why do you visit a vulgar place like that, Prince?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ERIC</span>. Where can I go? I have no one to talk with at home; and it
seems to me, for that matter, that people are equally good or bad
everywhere&mdash;although I prefer what is generally called bad company.&mdash;Do
you know John Andersson?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">JACOB</span>. [<i>Embarrassed</i>] I have never heard his name even. Who is he?</p>

<blockquote>

<p><span class="small-c">MARCUS</span> <i>and</i> <span class="small-c">DAVID</span> <i>go quietly out to the left</i>.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="small-c">ERIC</span>. A man from Småland who is full of sensible ideas.&mdash;Do you still
need to have your forehead bandaged?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">JACOB</span>. Do you think I wear the bandage as an ornament, or as a souvenir
of the city mob?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ERIC</span>. You should not bear a grudge against the good folk because some
scamp has misbehaved himself.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">JACOB</span>. I don't, my friend, and I know perfectly well what a stranger
must expect in a hostile country. If you come to Luebeck, you will see
how they stone Swedes.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ERIC</span>. You talk just like Jorghen Persson. Do you know him?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">JACOB</span>. I don't.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ERIC</span>. He looks at everything in the same way as you do.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">JACOB</span>. How do you mean?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ERIC</span>. He thinks every one is right, and that whatever happens is
<i>juste</i>. There is something sensible and enlightened in his view of
life. That's why my father hates him....</p>

<p><span class="small-c">JACOB</span>. Don't talk badly of your father. It sounds dreadful&mdash;if you will
pardon me!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ERIC</span>. But if he acts badly, why shouldn't I say so? And I hate him, for
that matter!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">JACOB</span>. Don't say that&mdash;don't! The greatness of your royal father is so
boundless that you can't grasp it.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ERIC</span>. It only looks that way&mdash;I know! Last night he came up to me and
put his arm around my shoulders&mdash;for the first time in my life&mdash;and I,
who have been living in the belief that I barely came up to his hip,
found to my surprise that I am as tall as he. But as soon as I looked
at him from a distance again, he grew taller and turned into a giant.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">JACOB</span>. That's what he is. And he resembles one of Buonarotti's
prophets&mdash;Isaiah, I think. And, verily, the Lord on high is with him.</p>

<p>ERIC. Do you really believe in God?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">JACOB</span>. Are you not ashamed of yourself?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ERIC</span>. Well, what are you to believe in times like these, when kings and
priests persecute the faithful and profane everything that used to be
held sacred. And yet they call themselves "defenders of the faith."</p>

<p><span class="small-c">JACOB</span>. Can't we talk of something else? Please, let us!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ERIC</span>. That's what the King always says when I go after him, and for
that reason I hate him still more&mdash;as he hates me! Do you know that it
was your father who brought my mother to him from Lauenburg?<a name="FNanchor_2_14" id="FNanchor_2_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_14" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>

<p><span class="small-c">JACOB</span>. No, I didn't know that.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ERIC</span>. Yes, but the marriage turned out badly. They hated each other
beyond all bounds&mdash;and one day [<i>he rises in a state of great
agitation</i>] I saw him raise his stick against her&mdash;[<i>roaring out the
words</i>] against my mother&mdash;and he struck her! That day I lost my
youth<a name="FNanchor_3_15" id="FNanchor_3_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_15" class="fnanchor">[3]</a>&mdash;and I can never forgive him&mdash;never!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">JACOB</span>. [<i>Leaps to his feet and put his arms about</i> Eric] Look at me,
Eric! Look at me! I have a stepmother, too&mdash;who is always tormenting me
when I am at home&mdash;but hush, hush! If it can help you to hear that I am
worse off than you&mdash;very much worse&mdash;then&mdash;you know it now! Remember
that it won't last for ever, as we are growing up to freedom....</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ERIC</span>. And you don't hate her?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">JACOB</span>. Such a feeling has no place beside the new one that is now
filling my soul.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ERIC</span>. That means&mdash;you are in love.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">JACOB</span>. That's what we may call it.... And when your own time comes,
you, too, will see your hatred change form and vanish.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ERIC</span>. I wonder!&mdash;Perhaps you are right The lovelessness in which I was
born and brought up has turned into a flame that is consuming my soul.
My blood was poisoned at my birth, and I doubt the existence of an
antidote.... Why do you leave me?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">JACOB</span>. Because ... because we are not allowed to be friends&mdash;because we
cannot be friends.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ERIC</span>. Do you think me so vile?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">JACOB</span>. No, no!&mdash;But I mustn't say anything more. Let us part. I shall
always watch your fate with sympathy, for I think you were born to
misfortune.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ERIC</span>. What makes you utter what I have thought so many times?&mdash;Do you
know that I was also born to be in the way? I stand in the way of my
father's desire to see Johan on the throne. I stand in the way of his
wish to forget the hated German woman. My mind has not the true Swedish
quality, and the fault lies in my German blood. Although I am a Vasa, I
am Saxony, too, and Lauenburg, and Brunswick. I am so little of a Swede
that it gives me pleasure when the free city of Luebeck imposes a penal
tax on my country&mdash;and keeps it humiliated.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">JACOB</span>. [<i>Looking hard at him</i>] Is that the truth, or do you merely talk
like that out of politeness?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ERIC</span>. [<i>Puts his hand to his sword, bid regains self-control
immediately</i>] Do you notice how much I love you, seeing that I
pardon such a question?&mdash;Yes, my friend, the first words taught me
by my mother were German, and in German I learned to say my evening
prayers&mdash;that old and beautiful "Heil dir, Maria, Mutter Gottes"....
Oh, that time&mdash;that time.... [<i>He weeps</i>] Oh, damn it! I am crying, I
think!&mdash;Come to the Blue Dove to-night, Jacob There you'll find Rhine
wine and merry maidens! Jorghen will be there, too. He's a man you
should know.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">JACOB</span>. [<i>Coldly and shrewdly</i>] I&mdash;shall&mdash;come.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ERIC</span>. Thank you, friend! [<i>Rising</i>] Really, the place has a look of
pawn-shop.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">JACOB</span>. [<i>Sharply</i>] That was just what I had in mind before.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ERIC</span>. Well, then we agree to that extent at least. Until to-night,
then! Do you know Agda?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">JACOB</span>. [<i>Brusquely</i>] No!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ERIC</span>. [<i>Haughtily, giving him two fingers to shake</i>, <span class="small-c">JACOB</span> <i>pretending
not to notice it</i>] Farewell!&mdash;What became of those two little
pawnbrokers?</p>

<blockquote>

<p><span class="small-c">JACOB</span> <i>does not answer</i>.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="small-c">ERIC</span>. [<i>Arrogantly</i>] Good-bye, then, Baruch!&mdash;Have you read the Book of
Baruch?</p>

<blockquote>

<p><i>Going toward the background, he jingles the altar vessels as
he passes them</i>.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="small-c">HERMAN ISRAEL</span>. [<i>Enters from the right</i>] Are you alone?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">JACOB</span>. Yes, father.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ISRAEL</span>. I heard somebody speaking.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">JACOB</span>. That was the Heir Apparent.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ISRAEL</span>. What did he want?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">JACOB</span>. I don't think he has the slightest idea of what he wants.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ISRAEL</span>. Is he your friend?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">JACOB</span>. Yes, so he calls himself, but I am not his. Because he thinks
that he is honouring me with his friendship, he flatters himself with
the belief that I return it.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ISRAEL</span>. You are frightfully wise for a young man of your age.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">JACOB</span>. Why, it's an axiom in the art of living, that you must not be
the friend of your enemy.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ISRAEL</span>. Can he be made useful?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">JACOB</span>. Running errands, perhaps, provided you keep him wholesomely
ignorant of the matter at stake. Otherwise I don't think I ever saw an
heir apparent more useless than this one.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ISRAEL</span>. Do you hate him?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">JACOB</span>. No, I pity him too much for that. He is more unfortunate than
he deserves. That he will end badly, seems pretty certain. It seems
clear to himself, too, and to such an extent that he appears anxious to
hasten the catastrophe.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ISRAEL</span>. Listen, my son. I have long noticed that I can keep no secrets
from you, and so I think it is better for me to tell you everything.
Sit down and give me your attention while I walk back and forth.... I
can think only when I am walking....</p>

<p><span class="small-c">JACOB</span>. Talk away, father. I am thinking all the time.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ISRAEL</span>. You have probably guessed that some great event is preparing
under the surface You have probably noticed that our free city of
Luebeck is fighting for its rights here in the North. I speak of
rights, because we have the right of the pioneer who has broken new
roads&mdash;roads of trade in this case&mdash;to demand compensation and profit
from the country on which he has spent his energy. We have taught these
people to employ their natural products and to exchange them with
profit; and we have set Sweden free. Having used us, they wish now to
cast us aside. That's always the way: use&mdash;and cast aside! But there
are greater and more powerful interests than those of trade that should
compel the North to join hands with the free cities. The Emperor and
the Pope are one. Our free cities made themselves independent first
of the Emperor and then of the Pope. Now, when this country has been
helped by us and its great King to do the same, we must, willy-nilly,
remain allies against the common enemy. And until quite recently we did
stick together. Then an evil spirit seemed to take possession of this
Vasa. Whether misled by pride or fatigue, he wishes now to enter a path
that must lead us all to disaster.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">JACOB</span>. Wait a little.&mdash;All of us, you say? You had better say "us of
Luebeck," for the Swedes will gain by entering that path.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ISRAEL</span>. Are you on their side?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">JACOB</span>. No, I am not. But I can perfectly well see where their advantage
lies. And I beg you, father, don't try to fight against Vasa, for he is
guided by the hand of the Lord! Have you not recognised that already?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ISRAEL</span>. I wonder how I could be such a fool as to give my confidence to
one still in his nonage!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">JACOB</span>. It won't hurt you to have your plans discussed from another
point of view than your own while there is still time to correct them.
And you know, of course, that you can rely on me. Go on, now!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ISRAEL</span>. No, I can't now.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">JACOB</span>. The pen won't write when its point has been broken. If you will
not get angry, I can tell you a little more myself.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">MARCUS</span>. [<i>Enters</i>] The one you have been waiting for is outside, sir.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">JACOB</span>. I suppose it is John Andersson.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ISRAEL</span>. Let him wait. [<i>Motions</i> <span class="small-c">MARCUS</span> <i>out of the room; then to</i>
Jacob] Do you know him, too?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">JACOB</span>. I have never seen him, but now I can figure out who he is.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ISRAEL</span>. [<i>Astounded</i>] You can figure it out, you say?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">JACOB</span>. I merely add one thing to another. Now, when the Dalecarlians
have been squelched, a new beginning will have to be made with the good
folk of Småland.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ISRAEL</span>. Of Småland, you say?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">JACOB</span>. Yes, I understand that this John Andersson is from Småland. I
don't think his name is John Andersson, however, but&mdash;[<i>in a lower
voice</i>] Nils Dacke!<a name="FNanchor_4_16" id="FNanchor_4_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_16" class="fnanchor">[4]</a></p>

<p><span class="small-c">ISRAEL</span>. Have you been spying?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">JACOB</span>. No, I merely listen, and look, and add together.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ISRAEL</span>. Well, you have made a false calculation this time.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">JACOB</span>. Thus you tell me that there are two persons concerned in the
matter, and that Nils Dacke is the silent partner who will not appear
until the war has begun.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ISRAEL</span>. I am afraid of you.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">JACOB</span>. You shouldn't be, father. I dare not do anything wrong, because
then I am always made to suffer.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ISRAEL</span>. Do you think I am doing anything wrong?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">JACOB</span>. You are more likely than I to do so, because, like Prince Eric,
you believe in nothing.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ISRAEL</span>. And such a thing I must hear from my own child!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">JACOB</span>. It is better than to hear it from other people's children&mdash;later
on.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">MARCUS</span>. [<i>Enters</i>] Two Dalecarlians ask to see you.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ISRAEL</span>. Tell them to wait.</p>

<blockquote>

<p><span class="small-c">MARCUS</span> <i>goes out</i>.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="small-c">JACOB</span>. They'll pay for it with their heads.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ISRAEL</span>. Who are they, then?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">JACOB</span>. Anders Persson of Rankhyttan and Mons Nilsson of Aspeboda, who
have tried in vain to get an audience with the King, and who are now
moved by their futile anger to turn to you for revenge.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ISRAEL</span>. So you know that, too?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">JACOB</span>. Without wishing to show you any disrespect, father&mdash;how can a
man of your age believe that secrets exist?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ISRAEL</span>. Time has run away from me. I don't know any longer where I
stand.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">JACOB</span>. Now you speak the truth! And I don't think that you estimate the
results of your venture correctly.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ISRAEL</span>. That will appear in due time. But now you must go, for even if
you know of my venture, you must not become involved in it.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">JACOB</span>. I shall obey, but you must listen to me.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ISRAEL</span>. No, you must listen to me! Tell Marcus that I shall expect my
visitors in the hall of state. You stay here with David and pack all
valuables into boxes ready to be sent southward.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">JACOB</span>. Father!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ISRAEL</span>. Silence!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">JACOB</span>. One word: don't rely on me if you should do anything wrong!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ISRAEL</span>. There is one thing <i>you</i> may rely on; that, having power of
life and death in this house, I shall see that every traitor is tried
and executed, whether he be my own son or no. First comes my country,
then my family; but first and last&mdash;my Arty! [<i>He puts his hand on his

<blockquote>

<p><i>A large room in the Blue Dove Inn. Wainscotted walls, with
tankards and jugs ranged along the shelf above the panels.
Benches fastened to the walls and covered with cushions and
draperies. In the background, a corner-stand with potted
flowers and bird-cages. Sconces containing wax candles are
hung on the walls; candelabra stand on a table that also
contains bowls of fruit, beakers, goblets, tumblers, dice,
playing-cards, and a lute</i>.</p>

<p><i>It is night</i>. <span class="small-c">PRINCE ERIC</span> <i>and</i> <span class="small-c">JORGHEN PERSSON</span> <i>are seated
at the table. They are looking pale and tired, and have ceased
drinking</i>.</p></blockquote>


<p><span class="small-c">ERIC</span>. You want to go to sleep, Jorghen, and I prefer to dream while
still awake. To go to bed is to me like dying: to be swathed in linen
sheets and stretch out in a long bed like a coffin. And then the corpse
has the trouble of washing itself and reading its own burial service.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">JORGHEN</span>. Are you afraid of death, Prince?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ERIC</span>. As the children are afraid of going to bed, and I am sure I'll
cry like a child when my turn comes. If I only knew what death is!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">JORGHEN</span>. Some call it a sleep, and others an awakening, but no one
knows anything with certainty.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ERIC</span>. How could we possibly know anything of that other life, when we
know so little of this one?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">JORGHEN</span>. Yes, what is life?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ERIC</span>. One large madhouse, it seems to me! Think of my sane and shrewd
and sensible father&mdash;doesn't he act like a madman? He rids the
country of foreigners and takes the heads of those that helped him. He
rids the country of foreigners only to drag in a lot of others, like
Peutinger and Norman,<a name="FNanchor_5_17" id="FNanchor_5_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_17" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> whom he puts above the lords of the realm
and all other authorities. He is mad, of course!&mdash;He rids the Church
of human inventions only to demand the acceptance of new inventions
at the penalty of death. This liberator is the greatest tyrant that
ever lived, and yet this tyrant is the greatest liberator that ever
lived! This evening, you know, he wanted to prohibit me from coming
here; and when I insisted on going all the same, he threw his Hungarian
war-hammer after me, as if he had been the god Thor chasing the trolls.
He came within an inch of killing me, just as it is said&mdash;which you may
not have heard&mdash;that he killed my mother.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">JORGHEN</span>. [<i>Becoming attentive</i>] No, I never heard of that.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ERIC</span>. That's what they say. And I can understand it. There is greatness
in it. To feel raised above all human considerations; to kill whatever
stands in the way? and trample everything else.... Sometimes, you know,
when I see him coming in his big, soft hat and his blue cloak, using
his boar-spear in place of a stick, I think he is Odin himself. When he
is angry, the people say that they can hear him from the top story down
to the cellars, and that the sound of it is like thunder. But I am not
afraid of him, and that's why he hates me. At the same time he has a
great deal of respect for me. [<span class="small-c">JORGHEN</span> <i>smiles sceptically</i>] Yes, you
may smile! That's only because you have no respect for anything; not,
even for yourself.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">JORGHEN</span>. That least of all.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ERIC</span>. Are you really such a beast?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">JORGHEN</span>. That's what every one thinks me, so I suppose I must believe
it.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ERIC</span>. [<i>Returning to his previous idea</i>] And.... There is a thought
that pursues me.... He looks like old Odin, I said: Odin who has
returned to despoil the temples of the Christians just as they once
robbed his temples.... You should have seen them weighing and counting
church treasures at Herman Israel's yesterday. It was ghastly!...
And do you know, he is lucky in everything he undertakes. There is
favourable wind whenever he goes sailing; the fish bite whenever he
goes fishing; he wins whenever he gambles. They say that he was born
with a caul....</p>

<p><span class="small-c">JORGHEN</span>. A most unusual man.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ERIC</span>. Do you know young Jacob, the son of Herman Israel? He promised to
come here to-night. Rather precocious, perhaps, but with sensible ideas
on certain subjects&mdash;and I think I admire some of his qualities because
I lack them myself.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">JORGHEN</span>. Is that so?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ERIC</span>. Otherwise he is probably a perfect rascal like his father.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">JORGHEN</span>. Then I shall be pleased to make his acquaintance.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ERIC</span>. Because he is a rascal?&mdash;Ha-ha!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">JORGHEN</span>. In spite of it!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">AGDA</span>. [<i>Enters from the left</i>] Did you call me, Prince?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ERIC</span>. No, but you are always welcome. Sit down here.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">AGDA</span>. The honour is too great for me.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ERIC</span>. Of course, it is!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">AGDA</span>. And so I leave&mdash;to save my honour.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ERIC</span>. Dare you sting, you gnat?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">AGDA</span>. That's your fancy only. I am too sensible and humble to hurt the
feelings of a great lord like yourself, my Prince.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ERIC</span>. Very good! Very good, indeed! Come here and talk to me a little
more.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">AGDA</span>. If your lordship commands, I must talk, of course, but....</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ERIC</span>. Give me the love that I have begged for so long!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">AGDA</span>. What one does not have one cannot give away.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ERIC</span>. Alas!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">AGDA</span>. Not loving your lordship, I cannot give you any love.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ERIC</span>. <i>Diantre</i>!&mdash;Give me your favour, then!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">AGDA</span>. Favours are not given away, but sold.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ERIC</span>. Listen to that! It is as if I heard my wise Jacob himself
philosophising. [<i>To</i> <span class="small-c">JORGHEN</span>] Did you ever hear anything like it?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">JORGHEN</span>. All wenches learn that kind of patter from their lovers.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ERIC</span>. Don't talk like that! This girl has won my heart.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">JORGHEN</span>. And some one else has won hers.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ERIC</span>. How do you know?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">JORGHEN</span>. You can hear it at once, even though the proofs be not visible.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ERIC</span>. Do you believe in love?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">JORGHEN</span>. In its existence, yes, but not in its duration.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ERIC</span>. Do you know how a woman's love is to be won?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">JORGHEN</span>. All that's necessary is to be "the right one." If you are not,
your case is hopeless.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ERIC</span>. That's a riddle.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">JORGHEN</span>. One of the greatest.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ERIC</span>. Who do you think can be my rival?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">JORGHEN</span>. Some clerk, or pikeman, or rich horsemonger.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ERIC</span>. And I who am not afraid of tossing my handkerchief to the proud
virgin-queen that rules Britannia!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">JORGHEN</span>. Yet it's true.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ERIC</span>. Perhaps Agda is too modest&mdash;and does not dare to believe in the
sincerity of my feelings?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">JORGHEN</span>. I don't believe anything of the kind.</p>

<blockquote>

<p><i>A noise is heard outside the door in the rear</i>.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="small-c">PRINCE JOHAN</span> [<i>Enters</i>] I hope my dear brother will pardon my intrusion
at this late hour, but I have been sent by our father out of fond
concern for my dear brother's....</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ERIC</span>. Be quick and brief, Jöns, or sit down and use a beaker as
punctuation mark! The sum of it is: the old man wants me to come home
and go to bed. Reply: the Heir Apparent decides for himself when he is
to sleep.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">JOHAN</span>. I shall not convey such a reply, especially as my dear brother's
disobedience may have serious results in this case.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ERIC</span>. Won't you sit down and drink a goblet, Duke?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">JOHAN</span>. Thank you, Prince, but I don't wish to cause my father sorrow.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ERIC</span>. How dreadfully serious that sounds!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">JOHAN</span>. It is serious. Our father has new and greater worries to face
because disturbances have been reported from the southern provinces,
especially from Småland.... And as it is possible that the King may
have to leave his capital, he looks to the Heir Apparent for assistance
in the administration of the government.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ERIC</span>. Half of which is nothing but lies, of course&mdash;and then there are
such a lot of people governing already. Go in peace, my brother. I
shall come when I come.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">JOHAN</span>. My duty is done, and all I regret is being unable to gain more
of my brother's ear; of his heart I possess no part at all! [<i>He goes
out</i>.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ERIC</span>. [<i>To</i> <span class="small-c">JORGHEN</span>] Can you make anything out of that boy?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">JORGHEN</span>. I can't.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ERIC</span>. I wonder if he believes in his own preachings?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">JORGHEN</span>. That is just the worst of it. Ordinary rascals like you and
me, who don't believe in anything, can't get words of that kind over
their lips; and for that reason we can never deceive anybody.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ERIC</span>. You <i>are</i> a beast, Jorghen.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">JORGHEN</span>. Of course, I am.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ERIC</span>. Is there nothing good in you at all?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">JORGHEN</span>. Not a trace! And besides&mdash;what is good? [<i>Pause</i>] My mother
was always saying that I should end on the gallows. Do you think one's
destiny is predetermined?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ERIC</span>. That's what Master Dionysius asserts&mdash;the Calvinist who uses Holy
Writ to prove that the dispensation of grace is not at all dependent on
man.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">JORGHEN</span>. Come on with the gallows then! That's the grace dispensed to
me.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ERIC</span>. That fellow Jacob says always that I was born to misfortune, and
that's what father says, too, when he gets angry. What do you think my
end will be?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">JORGHEN</span>. Was it not Saint Augustine who said that he who has been
coined into a groat can never become a ducat?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ERIC</span>. That's right. But I don't think we have drunk enough to make
us start any theological disputes. Here we have been disputing for a
lifetime now, and every prophet has been fighting all the rest. Luther
has refuted Augustine, Calvin has refuted Luther, Zwingli has refuted
Calvin, and John of Leyden has refuted all of them. So we know now just
where we stand!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">JORGHEN</span>. Yes, it's nothing but humbug, and if it were not for that kind
of humbug, I should never have been born.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ERIC</span>. What do you mean?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">JORGHEN</span>. Oh, you know perfectly well that my father was a monk who went
off and got married when they closed the monasteries. It means that
I'm a product of perjury and incest, as my father broke his oath and
established an illicit relationship like any unclean sheep.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ERIC</span>. You <i>are</i> a beast, Jorghen!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">JORGHEN</span>. Have I ever denied it?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ERIC</span>. No, but there are limits....</p>

<p><span class="small-c">JORGHEN</span>. Where?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ERIC</span>. Here and there! A certain innate sense of propriety generally
suggests the&mdash;approximate limits.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">JORGHEN</span>. Are you dreaming again, you dreamer?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ERIC</span>. Take care! There are limits even to friendship....</p>

<p><span class="small-c">JORGHEN</span>. No, mine is limitless!</p>

yourself the trouble of searching her bosom for it.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">JACOB</span>. Are you talking of Agda?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ERIC</span>. Do you know Agda the Chaste, who has told us that she would sell
her favours, but never give them away?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">AGDA</span>. My God, I never, never meant anything of the kind!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">JACOB</span>. No, she cannot possibly have meant it that way.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ERIC</span>. She has said it.</p>

by the thrifty King Gustavus for the storing of gold and silver and
other valuables. Compare the warning of Nils Söderby to Mons Nilsson's
wife in the first act: "Look out for the silver&mdash;the King is coming."</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_2_14" id="Footnote_2_14"></a><a href="#FNanchor_2_14"><span class="label">[2]</span></a> The first wife of Gustavus was the Princess Catherine of
Saxe-Lauenburg, whom he married in 1531, and who died in 1535. She was
of a very peculiar temperament and caused much trouble between the King
and his relatives by her reckless talk. Prince Eric was born in 1533.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_3_15" id="Footnote_3_15"></a><a href="#FNanchor_3_15"><span class="label">[3]</span></a> This is an excellent illustration of the freedom taken by
Strindberg in regard to the actual chronology of the historical facts
he is using. Eric was little more than a year old when his mother died.
Strindberg knew perfectly well what he was doing, his reason being that
the motive ascribed to Eric's hatred of his father strengthens the
dramatic quality of the play in a very high degree.</p></div>

rebellion Gustavus had to contend with during his entire reign. The
southern province of Småland had for years been the scene of peasant
disturbances when, in 1541, Dacke took command of the scattered
flocks and merged them into an army which defied the King's troops
for nearly two years. Dacke was as able as he was ambitious. He was
in communication with the German Emperor and other foreign enemies of
Gustavus, and on one occasion the latter had actually to enter into
negotiations with the rebel. In accordance with his invariable custom,
Gustavus did not rely on hired soldiery, but turned to the people of
the other provinces, explaining and appealing to them with such success
that a sufficient army was raised and Dacke beaten and killed in 1543.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_5_17" id="Footnote_5_17"></a><a href="#FNanchor_5_17"><span class="label">[5]</span></a> In his effort to reorganise the country and its
administration on a businesslike basis, Gustavus turned first to Swedes
like Olavus Petri and Laurentius Andreæ, his first chancellor. But
these were as independent of mind as he was himself, and there was not
a sufficient number of them. Then Gustavus turned to Germany, whence
a host of adventurers as well as able, honest men swarmed into the
country. The two best known and most trusted of these foreigners were
Georg Norman, who rendered valuable services in organising the civil
administration, and Conrad von Pyhy, said to be a plain charlatan named
Peutinger, who was made Chancellor of the Realm.</p></div>

<p><i>The King's study. The background consists almost wholly of
large windows, some of which have panes of stained glass.
Several of the windows are open, and through these may be seen
trees in the first green of spring. Mast tops with flying
flags, and church spires are visible above the tops of the
trees</i>.</p>

<p><i>Beneath the windows are benches set in the walls. Their seats
are covered by many-coloured cushions</i>.</p>

<p><i>At the right, a huge open fireplace, richly decorated.
The recently adopted national coat of arms appears on the
mantelpiece. A door on the same side leads to the waiting-room</i>.</p>

<p><i>A chair of state with canopy occupies the centre of the left
wall. In front of it stands a long oak table covered with
green cloth. On the table are a folio Bible, an inkstand,
candlesticks, a war-hammer, and a number of other things. A
door on the same side, nearer the background, leads to the
royal apartments</i>.</p>

<p><i>The floor is covered with animal skins and rugs</i>.</p>

<p><i>The walls display paintings of Old Testament subjects. The
most conspicuous of these represents "The Lord appearing unto
Abraham in the plains of Mamre." The picture of Abraham bears a
strong resemblance to the King</i>.</p>

<p><i>An Arabian water-bottle of clay and a silver cup stand on a
small cabinet</i>.</p>

<p><i>Near the door at the right hang a long and wide blue cloak and
a big black felt hat. A short boar-spear is leaned against the
wall</i>.</p>

<p><i>The</i> <span class="small-c">KING</span>, <i>lost in thought, stands by one of the open windows
where the full sunlight pours over him. He has on a black dress
of Spanish cut, with yellow linings that show in the seams and
through a number of slits. Over his shoulders is thrown a short
cloak trimmed with sable. His hair is blond, and his tremendous
beard, reaching almost to his waist, is still lighter in
colour.</i></p>

<p><i>The</i> <span class="small-c">QUEEN</span> <i>enters from the left. She wears a yellow dress
with black trimmings</i>.</p></blockquote>


<p><span class="small-c">KING</span>. [<i>Kissing her brow</i>] Good morrow, my rose!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">QUEEN</span>. A splendid morning!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">KING</span>. The first spring day after a long winter.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">QUEEN</span>. Is my King in a gracious mood to-day?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">KING</span>. My graciousness is not dependent on weather or wind.&mdash;Go on now!
Is it a question of Eric?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">QUEEN</span>. It is.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">KING</span>. Well, he has my good grace once more after having slept himself
sober in the tower. And Jorghen comes next, I suppose?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">QUEEN</span>. Yes.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">KING</span>. He, on the other hand, will not have my good grace until he
reforms.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">QUEEN</span>. But....</p>

<p><span class="small-c">KING</span>. He is bad through and through, and he is spoiling Eric. Whatever
may be the cause of his badness, I cannot dispose of it, but I can
check the effects. Have you any more protégés of the same kind?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">QUEEN</span>. I won't say anything more now.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">KING</span>. Then we can talk of something else. How is my mother-in-law?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">QUEEN</span>. Oh, you know.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">KING</span>. And Johan? Where is Johan?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">QUEEN</span>. He is not far away.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">KING</span>. I wish he were still nearer&mdash;nearer to me&mdash;so near that he could
succeed me when the time comes.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">QUEEN</span>. It is not right to think like that, and still less to talk like
that, when a higher Providence has already decided in favour of Prince
Eric.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">KING</span>. Well, I can't tell whether it was vanity that fooled me into
looking for a foreign princess or wisdom that kept me away from the
homes of our Swedish nobility&mdash;one hardly ever knows what one is doing.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">QUEEN</span>. That's true.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">KING</span>. But the feet that I became the brother-in-law of the Danish
king helped the country to get peace, and so nobody has any right to
complain.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">QUEEN</span>. The country first!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">KING</span>. The country first and last. That's why Eric must be married.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">QUEEN</span>. Do you really think he has any hopes with the English queen.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">KING</span>. I don't know, but we must find out&mdash;that is, without risking the
honour of the country. It is not impossible. We have had a British
princess on the throne before.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">QUEEN</span>. Who was that?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">KING</span>. Don't you know that Queen Philippa was a daughter of King Henry
IV?<a name="FNanchor_1_18" id="FNanchor_1_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_18" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

<p><span class="small-c">QUEEN</span>. No, I didn't know that.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">KING</span>. Then I suppose you don't know, either, that the Folkungs were
among your ancestors, and that you are also descended from King
Waldemar, the Conqueror of Denmark?<a name="FNanchor_2_19" id="FNanchor_2_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_19" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>

<p><span class="small-c">QUEEN</span>. No, no! I thought the bloody tale of the Folkungs was ended long
ago.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">KING</span>. Let us hope it is! But your maternal ancestor was nevertheless
a daughter of Eric Ploughpenny of Denmark and had a son with her
brother-in-law, King Waldemar of Sweden, the son of Earl Birger....</p>

<p><span class="small-c">QUEEN</span>. Why do you tell me all these dreadful stories?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">KING</span>. I thought it might amuse you to know that you have royal blood in
your veins, while I have peasant blood. You are too modest, Margaret,
and I wish to see you exalted&mdash;so high that that fool Eric will be
forced to respect you.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">QUEEN</span>. To have sprung from a crime should make one more modest.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">KING</span>. Well, that's enough about that. Was there anything else?</p>

<blockquote>

<p><i>The</i> <span class="small-c">QUEEN</span> <i>hesitates</i>.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="small-c">KING</span>. You are thinking of Anders Persson and Mons Nilsson, but I won't
let you talk of them.</p>

<blockquote>

<p><i>The</i> <span class="small-c">QUEEN</span> <i>kneels before him</i>.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="small-c">KING</span>. Please, get up! [<i>As she remains on her knees</i>] Then I must leave
you. [<i>He goes out to the left</i>.</p>

<blockquote>

<p><span class="small-c">PRINCE ERIC</span> <i>enters from the right; he is pale and unkempt, and
his face retains evidence of the night's carouse</i>.</p>

<p><i>The</i> <span class="small-c">QUEEN</span> <i>rises, frightened</i>.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="small-c">ERIC</span>. Did I scare you?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">QUEEN</span>. Not exactly.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ERIC</span>. I can take myself out of the way. I was only looking for a glass
of water.</p>

<blockquote>

<p><i>He goes to the water-bottle, fills a cup full of water and
gulps it down; then another, and still another</i>.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="small-c">QUEEN</span>. Are you sick?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ERIC</span>. [<i>Impertinently</i>] Only a little leaky.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">QUEEN</span>. What do you mean?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ERIC</span>. Well, dry, if you please. The more wine you drink, the dryer gets
your throat. The wetter, the dryer&mdash;that's madness, like everything
else.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">QUEEN</span>. Why do you hate me?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ERIC</span>. [<i>Cynically</i>] Because I am not allowed to love you. [<i>In the
meantime he continues to pour down one glass of water after the other</i>]
You must not be in love with your step-mother and yet you must love
her: that's madness, too.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">QUEEN</span>. Why do you call me stepmother?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ERIC</span>. Because that's the word, and that's what you are. Is that clear?
If it is, then that isn't madness at least.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">QUEEN</span>. You have the tongue of a viper.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ERIC</span>. And the reason, too.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">QUEEN</span>, But no heart!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ERIC</span>. What could I do with it? Throw it at the feet of the women to be
defiled by them?&mdash;My heart lies buried in my mother's coffin in the
vault of the Upsala cathedral. I was only four years old when it was
put there, but there it lies with her, and they tell me there was a
hole in her head as if she had been struck by the hammer of Thor&mdash;which
I did not see, however. When I asked to see my mother for the last
time at the burial, they had already screwed on the coffin lid. Well,
there lies my heart&mdash;the only one I ever had What have you to do with
my entrails, for that matter? Or with my feelings?&mdash;Look out for my
reason; that's all! I grasp your thoughts before you have squeezed
them out of yourself. I understand perfectly that you would like to
see the crown placed on the red hair of that red devil whom you call
son, and whom I must needs call brother. He insists that he has more
ancestors than I, and that he is descended from Danish kings. If that's
so, he has a lot of fine relatives. Eric Ploughpenny had his head cut
off. Abel killed his brother and was killed in turn. Christoffer was
poisoned. Eric the Blinking was stuck like a pig.&mdash;I have no elegant
relatives like those, but if heredity counts, I must keep an eye on my
dear brother.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">QUEEN</span>. Nobody can talk of anything but blood and poison to-day. The sun
must have risen on the wrong side this fine morning!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ERIC</span>. The sun is a deceiver; don't trust it. Blood will be shed in this
place before nightfall. Eric and Abel were the names of those elegant
relatives; not Cain and Abel! And that time it was Abel who killed
Cain&mdash;no, Eric, I mean! That's a fine omen to start with! Eric was
killed! Poor Eric!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">QUEEN</span>. Alas, alas!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ERIC</span>. But it is of no use to take any stock in superstition, as I
entered this vale of misery with my fist full of blood.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">QUEEN</span>. Now you do scare me!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ERIC</span>. [<i>Laughing</i>] That's more than Jorghen would believe&mdash;that I
could scare anybody.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">QUEEN</span>. What blood is to be shed here to-day?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ERIC</span>. I am not sure, but it is said that those Dalecarlians will have
their heads cut off.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">QUEEN</span>. Can it not be prevented?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ERIC</span>. If it is to be, it cannot be prevented, but must come as thunder
must come after lightning. And besides, what does it matter? Heads are
dropping off here like ripe apples.</p>

<p><i>The</i> <span class="small-c">KING</span> <i>enters reading a document. The</i> <span class="small-c">QUEEN</span> <i>meets him
with a supplicating look</i>.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="small-c">KING</span>. [<i>Hotly</i>] If you have any faith in me at all, Margaret, cease
your efforts to judge in matters of state. I have been investigating
for two years without being able to make up my mind. How can you, then,
hope to grasp this matter?&mdash;Go in to the children now. I have a word
to say to Eric!</p>

<blockquote>

<p><i>The</i> <span class="small-c">QUEEN</span> <i>goes out</i>.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="small-c">KING</span>. If you could see yourself as you are now, Eric, you would despise
yourself!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ERIC</span>. So I do anyhow!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">KING</span>. Nothing but talk! If you did despise yourself, you would change
your ways.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ERIC</span>. I cannot make myself over.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">KING</span>. Have you ever tried?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ERIC</span>. I have.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">KING</span>. Then your bad company must counteract your good intentions.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ERIC</span>. Jorghen is no worse than anybody else, but he has the merit of
knowing himself no better than the rest.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">KING</span>. Do you bear in mind that you are to be king some time?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ERIC</span>. Once I am king, the old slips will be forgotten.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">KING</span>. There you are mistaken again. I am still paying for old slips.
However, if you are not willing to obey me as a son, you must obey me
as a subordinate.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ERIC</span>. The Heir Apparent is no subject!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">KING</span>. That's why I used the word "subordinate." And all are subordinate
to the King.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ERIC</span>. Must I obey blindly?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">KING</span>. As long as you are blind, you must obey blindly. When you get
your sight, you will obey with open eyes. But obey you must!&mdash;Wait only
till you have begun to command, and you will soon see how much more
difficult that is, and how much more burdensome.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ERIC</span>. [<i>Pertly</i>] Pooh!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">KING</span>. [<i>Angrily</i>] Idiot!&mdash;Go and wash the dirt off yourself, and see
that your hair is combed. And rinse that filthy mouth of yours first of
all, so that you don't stink up my rooms. Go now&mdash;or I'll give you a
week in the tower to sober up. And if that should not be enough, I'll
take off your ears, so that you can never wear a crown. Are those words
plain enough?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ERIC</span>. The law of succession....</p>

<p><span class="small-c">KING</span>. I make laws of that kind to suit myself! Do you understand
now?&mdash;That's all!&mdash;Away!</p>

<blockquote>

<p><span class="small-c">PRINCE ERIC</span> <i>goes out</i>.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="small-c">COURTIER</span>. [<i>Enters from the right</i>] Herman Israel, Councillor of
Luebeck!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">KING</span>. Let him come.</p>

<blockquote>

<p><i>The</i> <span class="small-c">COURTIER</span> <i>goes out</i>. <span class="small-c">HERMAN ISRAEL</span> <i>enters shortly
afterward</i>.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="small-c">KING</span>. [<i>Meets him and shakes his hand; then he puts his arm about his
neck and leads him across the floor in that manner]</i> Good day, my dear
old friend, and welcome! Sit down, sit down! [<i>He seats himself on the
chair of state, and</i> <span class="small-c">ISRAEL</span> <i>sits down across the table</i>] So you have
just come from Dalecarlia?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ISRAEL</span>. That's where I was lately.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">KING</span>. I was there, too, as you know, to straighten out the mess left
after the False Sture and the fight about the bells, but you stayed on
when I left.&mdash;Did you keep an eye on Master Olavus Petri? What sort of
a man has he turned out? Can I trust him?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ISRAEL</span>. Absolutely! He is not only the most faithful, but the cleverest
negotiator I have seen.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">KING</span>. Really, Herman? I am glad to hear that. Do you really think so,
Herman? Well, you know the old affair between him and me, and how that
was settled. But it <i>was</i> settled!&mdash;So much for that. Let us talk of
our affairs now.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ISRAEL</span>. As you say. But let us keep our words as well as actions under
control.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">KING</span>. [<i>Playing with the war-hammer</i>] All right! Control yours as much
as you please.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ISRAEL</span>. [<i>Pointing at the hammer</i>] For the sake of old friendship and
good faith, can't we put that away?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">KING</span>. Ha-ha! With pleasure, if you are afraid of it, Herman!&mdash;Go on
now! But cut it short!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ISRAEL</span>. Then I'll start at the end. The country's debt to Luebeck has
been paid, and we are about to part.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">KING</span>. That sounds like writing! However, we shall part as friends.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ISRAEL</span>. As allies rather....</p>

<p><span class="small-c">KING</span>. So <i>that's</i> what you are aiming at, Israel?&mdash;No, I have had
enough of dependence.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ISRAEL</span>. Listen, your Highness, or Majesty, or whatever I am to call
you....</p>

<p><span class="small-c">KING</span>. Call me Gustav, as you used to do when I called you father.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ISRAEL</span>. Well, my son, there are many things that drive us apart&mdash;many,
indeed&mdash;but there is one thing that keeps us together: our common,
legitimate opposition to the Emperor....</p>

<p><span class="small-c">KING</span>. Right you are! And that's the reason why we can rely on each
other without any written treaties.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ISRAEL</span>. You forget one thing, my son: that I am a merchant....</p>

<p><span class="small-c">KING</span>. And I the customer. Have you been paid?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ISRAEL</span>. Paid? Yes.... But there are things that cannot be paid in
money....</p>

<p><span class="small-c">KING</span>. It is for me to speak of the gratitude I owe you and the free
city of Luebeck ever since the day I first came to you&mdash;a young man
who thought himself deserted by God, and who knew himself deserted
by all humanity. Be satisfied to find my gratitude expressed in the
friendly feelings I harbour and show toward you. A debt like that
cannot be paid in money, and still less in treaties.&mdash;Why do you want
any treaties? In order to tie me and the country for a future of
uncertain duration?&mdash;Don't force me to become ungrateful, Herman! On my
soul, I have enough as it is to burden me&mdash;far too much!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ISRAEL</span>. What is weighing on you, my son?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">KING</span>. This.... Oh, will you believe me, Herman, old friend, that
lawyer form a decision or pass a judgment without having turned to the
Eternal and Almighty Lord for advice? When, after fasting, prayer, and
meditation, I have got the answer from above that I was asking for,
then I strike gladly, even if it be my own heart-roots that must be cut
off. But you remember Master John.... John, the old friend of my youth,
who assisted me in that first bout with Christian? He changed heart and
incited the Dalecarlians to rise against me. His head had to fall, and
it did fall! [<i>Rising</i>] Since that day my peace is gone. My nearest and
dearest don't look at me in the same way they used to do. My own wife,
my beloved Margaret.... She turns away from me when I want to kiss her
pure brow, and can you imagine? Yesterday, at the dinner-table, she
kept looking at my hand as if she had seen blood on it!&mdash;I don't regret
what I did. I have no right to regret it. I was right&mdash;by God, I was
right! But nevertheless&mdash;my peace is gone!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ISRAEL</span>. [<i>Pensively</i>] Those feelings are an honour to your heart, my
son, and I must admit that I didn't think you quite as sensitive....</p>

<p><span class="small-c">KING</span>. Never mind! It was not meant as a boast. But now I find myself in
the same situation again. Tell me, Herman, what you think of Anders
Persson and Mons Nilsson.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ISRAEL</span>. [<i>Disturbed</i>] Will my opinion have any influence on their fate,
or have you already made up your mind?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">KING</span>. I am still in doubts, as you ought to know.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ISRAEL</span>. Then I must ask permission to remain silent.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">KING</span>. Are you my friend?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ISRAEL</span>. Yes, up to a certain point. But you must not trust me too far,
as I am not my own master and have no right to give away what is not
mine.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">KING</span>. Fie on such astuteness!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ISRAEL</span>. You should get some of it yourself!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">KING</span>. I'll try.&mdash;First of all you must give me a final receipt for the
country's paid-up debt.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ISRAEL</span>. I don't carry such documents with me, and the receipt has to be
signed by the Council in regular session.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">KING</span>. [<i>Smiting the table with the hammer</i>] Herman!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ISRAEL</span>. Please put that thing away!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">KING</span>. I can see that you wish to lead me where I don't want to go. You
have some purpose in mind that I can't make out. Speak out, old man, or
you'll have me in a rage! You want to coax me into signing some kind of
paper. What is it?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ISRAEL</span>. Nothing but a treaty providing for mutual friendship and mutual
trade. That's all!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">KING</span>. And that I will never sign! I know all about Luebeck's friendship
as well as its trade. Talk of something else!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ISRAEL</span>. I have nothing else to talk of. Why don't you believe me?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">KING</span>. Because you lie!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ISRAEL</span>. Because you are unfortunate enough to think that I lie, you
will never know the truth.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">KING</span>. Yes, unfortunate, indeed&mdash;as unfortunate as a man can be, for I
have not a single friend.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ISRAEL</span>. It hurts me to hear you talk like that, Gustav, and&mdash;and it
makes me sad to see that your greatness and your exalted office have
brought you so little true happiness. I shall say nothing more about
gratitude, because the idea of it is too vague in human minds, but I
have loved you like a son ever since that hour when the Lord of Hosts
put your fate in my hands. I have followed your brilliant course as
if it had been my own. I have joyed over your successes, and I have
sorrowed over your sorrows.... Frequently my duties toward my own
people have kept me from lending you a helping hand. Frequently, too,
your own hardness has stood between us. But now, when I behold you so
deeply crushed, and when you have treated me with a confidence that
I may well call filial, I shall forget for a moment that I am your
enemy&mdash;which I must be as a man of Luebeck, while as Herman Israel I am
your friend. I shall forget that I am a merchant, and&mdash;[<i>Pause</i>] I hope
that I may never regret it&mdash;[<i>Pause</i>] and&mdash;and.... Do you know John
Andersson?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">KING</span>. I don't.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ISRAEL</span>. But I do, and I know Anders Persson and Mons Nilsson, too! They
called on me yesterday, and&mdash;to-morrow the southern provinces will rise
in rebellion!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">KING</span>. So <i>that's</i> what was coming? Oh! Who is John Andersson?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ISRAEL</span>. Hard to tell. But back of his face appears another one that
looks like the devil's own. Have you heard the name of Dacke?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">KING</span>. Yes, but only in a sort of dream. Dacke?&mdash;Dacke?&mdash;It sounds like
the cawing of a jackdaw.&mdash;Who is he?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ISRAEL</span>. Nobody knows. It is the name of one invisible, whom all know
and none have seen. But that name has been seen on a letter signed
by&mdash;the Emperor.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">KING</span>. The Emperor?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ISRAEL</span>. The Emperor of the Holy Roman and German Empire!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">KING</span>. Fairy-tales!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ISRAEL</span>. You won't believe me? Investigate!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">KING</span>. I believe you and I thank you!&mdash;You say that Anders Persson and
Mons Nilsson have been plotting with the rebels right here in my own
city?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ISRAEL</span>. As surely as I have ears to hear with.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">KING</span>. My God! My God!&mdash;Then I know what to do with them! Two years of
struggle with myself and my conscience, and at last I know what to do
with them! At last!</p>

accuse your father? Answer me yes or no.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">JACOB</span>. Yes!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ISRAEL</span>. Go then, and take my curse with you!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">JACOB</span>. [<i>Kneeling before</i> <span class="small-c">ISRAEL</span>] Forgive, father!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ISRAEL</span>. No more your father! You silly, impudent youth, who think that
you understand the art of statesmanship and the laws of honour better
than he who brought you into the world! What you did not foresee was
that I might change my mind.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">KING</span>. Oh, forgive him, Herman!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ISRAEL</span>. I have forgiven him already, but our sacred laws will never
do so. Take this ring, Jacob, and go to&mdash;you know whom!&mdash;But bid me
good-bye first.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ISRAEL</span>. [<i>Deeply stirred</i>] That is a family secret. Now we can go on.</p>

Herman, and I thank you for the last time. Give me your hand!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ISRAEL</span>. Not to promise anything that cannot be kept!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">KING</span>. No promises, then! Farewell, and peace be with you!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">KING</span>. [<i>Greeting her kindly</i>] Good morning, mother-in-law.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">MOTHER-IN-LAW</span>. Are you busy?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">KING</span>. Very much so.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">MOTHER-IN-LAW</span>. But not so much that you cannot hear the justified
complaint of a subject.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">KING</span>. You are too modest. However, let me decide whether your complaint
be justified or no. I must hear too many unjustified ones, God wot!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">MOTHER-IN-LAW</span>. If I condescend to make a complaint, you may be sure
that I have reasons for it.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">KING</span>. But they must be good. Most reasons are no good at all.&mdash;Is it a
question of Anders Persson and Mons Nilsson?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">MOTHER-IN-LAW</span>. No, of myself.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">KING</span>. Then you should be well informed at least.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">MOTHER-IN-LAW</span>. Is there law and justice in this country?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">KING</span>. Both law and justice, but also a lot of wrong-doing.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">MOTHER-IN-LAW</span>. Do you know that the Queen's mother&mdash;that is, I&mdash;has
been insulted by the mob?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">KING</span>. No, I didn't know, but I have long expected it, as I have told
you before this.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">MOTHER-IN-LAW</span>. You think it right, then?...</p>

<p><span class="small-c">KING</span>. No, I think it wrong of you to wear that dress in public, when
it is forbidden. And it is only out of respect for yourself and
your&mdash;hm!&mdash;sex, that I have not long ago ordered you to be stripped of
it.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">MOTHER-IN-LAW</span>. Ha-ha!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">KING</span>. And it has been wrong of me to leave the Convent of Vreta
standing for you to live in, when the law demands that it be tom down.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">MOTHER-IN-LAW</span>. Ha-ha!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">KING</span>. Since you, by persuading me into letting the convent remain, have
placed me before the public in the awkward position of a perverter
of justice, you should, at least, show me the consideration of not
appearing on the streets in that dress. And as I have given you
permission to come here <i>at your own risk</i>, you must bear that risk
yourself. To show you that justice exists, however, I shall see that
those who insulted you be found&mdash;they had no right to insult you, even
if you had been the humblest woman of the people. Now that matter is
settled! [<i>He goes to the door at the right and summons the</i> <span class="small-c">COURTIER</span>,
<i>who appears in the doorway</i>] Call four of the guards. Put two at
that door [<i>indicating the door at the left</i>] and two at the other
[<i>indicating the right-hand door</i>.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">MOTHER-IN-LAW</span>. Thus I am treated like a thief and a murderer by my own
kinsman....</p>

<p><span class="small-c">KING</span>. No, you are not! But no one knows what may happen.... It depends
on your own conduct.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">MOTHER-IN-LAW</span>. [<i>With a threat in her glance</i>] Do you call that freedom?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">KING</span>. It is freedom for me&mdash;to be free from unreasonable people.</p>

<blockquote>

<p><i>Two guards enter from the right</i>.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="small-c">KING</span>. [<i>Pointing at the left-hand door</i>] Outside that door. And no
one can get in here; literally no one! [<i>As the guards hesitate</i>]
If anybody should come, whoever it be&mdash;whoever it be, mind you&mdash;and
try to force his way in here, cut him down&mdash;cut him down! [<i>To his</i>
<span class="small-c">MOTHER-IN-LAW</span>] I cannot show you the door, but I must warn you that two
executions will take place in this room within a few minutes.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">MOTHER-IN-LAW</span>. Here?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">KING</span>. Yes, here! Do you wish to look on?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">MOTHER-IN-LAW</span>. [<i>Approaching the door at the left</i>] I shall go in a
moment, but first you must hear something for your own benefit....</p>

<p><span class="small-c">KING</span>. If it is for <i>my</i> benefit, I can guess the nature of it. Well,
spit it out now!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">MOTHER-IN-LAW</span>. This man Herman Israel, whom you regard as a friend, is
speaking ill of you on your back.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">KING</span>. When I do what's ill, he has the right to speak ill of me&mdash;has he
not?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">MOTHER-IN-LAW</span>. [<i>Going out in a huff</i>] Oh, it's impossible to reason
with you!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">KING</span>. Have you really discovered that at last?&mdash;At last! [<i>He goes to
the door at the right</i>] Let Master Olavus Petri come in.</p>

<blockquote>

<p><span class="small-c">MASTER OLAVUS</span> <i>enters</i>.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="small-c">KING</span>. Good day, Olof. I have read your report on the conditions at
Copperberg, and I am pleased with you.&mdash;Have Anders Persson and Mons
Nilsson been arrested?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">OLAVUS</span>. They have been locked up since last night.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">KING</span>. [<i>Goes to the door at the right</i>] Order Anders Persson and Mons
Nilsson to be brought up here at once. [<i>To</i> <span class="small-c">OLAVUS</span>] Have you any proof
that the prisoners have been plotting with John Andersson?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">OLAVUS</span>. Proof and witnesses.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">KING</span>. Good!&mdash;Tell me something What do you think of Herman Israel&mdash;as a
man, and more particularly in his relationship to me?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">OLAVUS</span>. He seems to me a good and faithful friend of your Highness.
As a private person he is honest in every respect, big-minded, and
straight in all his actions.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">KING</span>. I am glad to hear it just now, when I have all but lost my faith
in friendship. So you think I can rely on him?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">OLAVUS</span>. Absolutely.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">KING</span>. Have you heard of the restlessness in the southern provinces?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">OLAVUS</span>. Yes, I am sorry to say.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">KING</span>. They say that it is pretty serious.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">OLAVUS</span>. So serious that nothing but quick and determined action can
save the country.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">KING</span>. Have you heard the Emperor's name mentioned in this connection?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">OLAVUS</span>. I have.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">KING</span>. I want a piece of advice, although I may not take it. What would
you, in my place, do with Anders Persson and Mons Nilsson?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">OLAVUS</span>. Have them executed before the sun has set.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">KING</span>. You are a stem man, Olof!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">OLAVUS</span>. Yes, why not?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">KING</span>. Do you think you could sleep nights&mdash;having shown that kind
of&mdash;sternness?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">OLAVUS</span>. Only then should I be able to sleep in peace....</p>

<p><span class="small-c">KING</span>. Very well!&mdash;Have you anything to ask me about?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">OLAVUS</span>. I have&mdash;but it's a delicate question.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">KING</span>. Let's see!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">OLAVUS</span>. It concerns the mother of the Queen....</p>

<p><span class="small-c">KING</span>. The people are muttering?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">OLAVUS</span>. The people think that when the King has ordered the
introduction of a new faith, he should not for family reasons overlook
the violation of the established law....</p>

<p><span class="small-c">KING</span>. It's not the people, but you, who are saying that....</p>

<p><span class="small-c">OLAVUS</span>. Suppose I took the liberty of telling my King the truth....</p>

<p><span class="small-c">KING</span>. You're no court fool who needs to run about dropping truths
wherever you go! [<i>Pause</i>] Now, I am willing to admit that the
indiscretion of my gracious mother-in-law puts me in a false position
toward the adherents of the new faith.... But this is not the
bedchamber, and we'll let that question stay where it belongs; back of
the bed curtains. Is there anything else?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">OLAVUS</span>. Nothing else. But this question....</p>

<p><span class="small-c">KING</span>. [<i>Hotly</i>] I'll solve myself!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">OLAVUS</span>. Can your Highness solve it?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">KING</span>. I think you ask too many questions!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">OLAVUS</span>. If it were a private matter, yes&mdash;but as it concerns the whole
country....</p>

<p><span class="small-c">KING</span>. Which I am looking after! I am looking after the whole country.
And if you must know, I have just settled that very question, so that
your advice is a little belated. The Convent of Vreta will be closed
before you have time to write another sermon. Do you realise now that I
have a right to be angry with your needless and unsolicited questions?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">OLAVUS</span>. I stand corrected!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">KING</span>. I have got you on account of my sins, and I suppose I must take
your faults with your merits, which are great. Now we are done with
<i>that I</i> Go back and roar in your pulpit now. Here I do the roaring!</p>

<blockquote>

<p><span class="small-c">MASTER OLAVUS</span> <i>goes out by the door at the right</i>.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="small-c">KING</span>. [<i>Standing in front of that door with folded hands and speaking
in a barely audible voice</i>] Eternal Lord, who rules the destinies of
princes and of peoples, illumine my mind and strengthen my will, so
that I may not judge unrighteously! [<i>He makes the sign of the cross
and mutters a brief prayer; then he opens the door</i>] Bring in the
prisoners!</p>

<blockquote>

<p><i>The door remains open while the</i> <span class="small-c">KING</span> <i>seats himself in the
chair of state</i>.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ANDERS PERSSON</span> <i>and</i> <span class="small-c">MONS NILSSON</span> <i>are brought in</i>. <i>They look
around the room uneasily at first; then they start toward the</i>
<span class="small-c">KING</span>.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="small-c">KING</span>. Stay where you are! [<i>Pause</i>] Once I called you my friends,
Anders Persson and Mons Nilsson. You know why. But that was long ago.
I let you keep life and goods when you had forfeited both, and thus
Providence rid me mercifully of the debt of gratitude I had come to owe
you. Two years ago you withdrew your oath of loyalty and opened war on
me for the sake of those bells. Being victorious, I had a right to your
heads, but I let you go. That's how my debt was paid. Your ingratitude
wiped out my gratitude, and so <i>that</i> bill was settled. Now the time
has come for a new settlement, and this time the balance is against
you. To find out just where you stood, I invited you to my capital, and
you might have guessed that I would keep my eyes on you. My ears have
been open, too, and I have learned that you have begun plotting all
over again. Do you know John Andersson?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ANDERS</span> <i>and</i> <span class="small-c">MONS</span>. No!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">KING</span>. [<i>Rising and approaching them angrily</i>] Do you know Dacke?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ANDERS</span> <i>and</i> <span class="small-c">MONS</span>. [<i>Falling on their knees</i>] Mercy!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">KING</span>. Yes, mercy! But there will be no more mercy. You have had it
once, and twice is too much.</p>

<blockquote>

<p><span class="small-c">ANDERS</span> <i>and</i> <span class="small-c">MONS</span> <i>make movements to speak</i>.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="small-c">KING</span>. Silence! I am doing the speaking now! You were going to talk
about friendship, of course. I cannot be the friend of my enemies,
and having cancelled your acquaintance, I don't even know you. Were
I to let old devotion influence my judgment, I should not be acting
as an unbiassed judge. And he who has incurred the disfavour of the
law cannot be helped by any favour of mine! That's enough words spent
on this matter! [<i>Goes to the door at the right</i>] Take away these
culprits, guard!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ANDERS</span>. What is the sentence?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">KING</span>. That you lose life, honour, and property.</p>

<blockquote>

<p><span class="small-c">MONS</span> <i>makes a gesture as if wishing to shake hands with the</i>
<span class="small-c">KING</span>.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="small-c">KING</span>. <i>My</i> hand? Oh, no! Shake hands with the heads-man, and kiss the
block&mdash;that's good enough for you!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ANDERS</span>. One word!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">KING</span>. Not one!</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">FIRST SCENE</p>


<blockquote>

<p><i>A square at the foot of Brunkeberg, A fountain stands in the
centre. The Hansa House appears at the right. It is built of
red bricks, with windows in Gothic style. The windows are
barred outside and have shutters within. The gates are fastened
with heavy wooden beams. Above the gateway appear the flag and
coat of arms of Luebeck.</i></p>

<p><i>At the left is a tavern with a sign-board bearing the
inscription: "The Golden Apple." There are trees in front of
it, and under these tables and benches. Next the foreground is
a bower with a table and benches within it</i>.</p>

<p><i>The hillside of Brunkeberg forms the background. It contains a
number of gallows, wheels, and similar paraphernalia.</i></p>

<p><i>There is a bench in front of the Hanseatic office</i>.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">AGDA</span> <i>and</i> <span class="small-c">KARIN</span> <i>are standing at the fountain when the curtain
rises</i>. <span class="small-c">AGDA</span> <i>carries a water-jar, while</i> <span class="small-c">KARIN</span> <i>has a basket
full of flowers and wreaths</i>.</p></blockquote>


<p><span class="small-c">AGDA</span>. You ask what that big red house is? It used to be the Convent of
St. Clara. Now it is the Hanseatic office.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">KARIN</span>. Do they ever buy any flowers there?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">AGDA</span>. Not now, I think. I used to bring flowers there when an image of
the Virgin Mary stood at the corner.&mdash;I wish she were there still!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">KARIN</span>. What do they do in that house? They tell so many queer stories
about it, and no one is ever admitted....</p>

<p><span class="small-c">AGDA</span>. Have you heard that, too? I suppose they buy and sell, like all
that come from Luebeck.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">KARIN</span>. Of course, but they say that people have disappeared in that
house and that those who live there are heathens who sacrifice....</p>

<p><span class="small-c">AGDA</span>. You have heard that, too? But it can't be true! Do you think so?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">KARIN</span>. How could I tell? And why are you so disturbed by those stories?
[<span class="small-c">AGDA</span> <i>does not reply</i>] Gossip says that you used to have a friend in
there. Is it true?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">AGDA</span>. Well, as you have heard about it But whether he still be there
Oh, if I only knew!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">KARIN</span>. I'll ring and ask.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">AGDA</span>. No, no! You don't know what kind of people they are!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">KARIN</span>. Do you think they'll eat me? [<i>She goes up to the gateway and
putts a string; a bell is heard ringing inside</i>] Listen! That's the old
vesper bell! I know it! Bing-bong! Bing-bong!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">AGDA</span>. Stop it! Somebody might come.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">KARIN</span>. Isn't that what we want? But no one does come, my dear.&mdash;It's
a gruesome place. And I shall leave it alone now.&mdash;Do you know Prince
Eric, Agda?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">AGDA</span>. Yes, it was on his account they closed up the Blue Dove. Now I am
working over there, at the Golden Apple.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">KARIN</span>. They say that he used to be very polite to you.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">AGDA</span>. No, he was most impolite, not to say nasty.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">KARIN</span>. He had been drinking then. Otherwise he is merely miserable,
they say.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">AGDA</span>. Do you know him?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">KARIN</span>. No, I have only seen him, but I cannot forget his sad eyes and
his long face. He looks so much like a doll I had once&mdash;I called it
Blinkie Bloodless.... I suppose they are not kind to him at home,
either.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">AGDA</span>. Probably not, but a man has no right to act like a brute because
he is unhappy.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">KARIN</span>. Why do you talk like that? He drinks a lot of wine, like most
young men and Hush! Somebody is coming....</p>

<p><span class="small-c">AGDA</span>. Good-bye, Karin. I have to run....</p>

<blockquote>

<p>[<i>She hurries into the tavern at the left</i>.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="small-c">KARIN</span>. [<i>As she goes to the right</i>] I'll be back.</p>

<blockquote>

<p><span class="small-c">PRINCE ERIC</span> <i>and</i> <span class="small-c">JORGHEN PERSSON</span> <i>enter from the rear</i>.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="small-c">ERIC</span>. Here's my new well-spring of wine. Come quick to the bower here.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">JORGHEN</span>. And Agda is here, too!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ERIC</span>. Well, what of it? [<i>Rapping on the table</i>.</p>

<blockquote>

<p><span class="small-c">AGDA</span> <i>appears</i>.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="small-c">ERIC</span>. [<i>To</i> <span class="small-c">AGDA</span>] Bring us some Rhine wine and then make yourself
invisible. [<i>To</i> <span class="small-c">JORGHEN</span>] You know, Jorghen, I am facing a crucial
moment and must be ready to act at once. The King has lost his reason
and is committing acts that cannot be defended! Yesterday he cut off
the heads of those Dalecarlians. To-day comes the news that his troops
have been beaten by the peasants of Småland, who are now crossing
Holaved Forest.<a name="FNanchor_1_20" id="FNanchor_1_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_20" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> Now the Dalecarlians will rise, of course, and
everything is lost.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">JORGHEN</span>. What does that concern us? Let the world perish, and I shall
laugh at it.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ERIC</span>. But this is what beats everything else for madness. Finding his
treasury empty, the King, in his incredible simplicity, tries to borrow
money from these Luebeckians, who are his enemies.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">JORGHEN</span>. Well, if you need money, your enemies are the best ones to
take it from.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ERIC</span>. If I am not crazy already, you'll make me so! Please be serious a
moment!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">JORGHEN</span>. [<i>Recites</i>]</p>

<p><i>At that moment</i> <span class="small-c">AGDA</span> <i>appears with the wine</i>.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="small-c">ERIC</span>. [<i>Laughing idiotically at</i> <span class="small-c">JORGHEN'S</span> <i>recitation</i>] Ha-ha! That's
a good one. But then, I made it myself.&mdash;Well, Agda, or Magda, or what
it is, where's your pawnbroker to-day?</p>

<blockquote>

<p><span class="small-c">AGDA</span> <i>does not reply</i>.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="small-c">ERIC</span>. Do you know that those Hanseatic people are in the habit of
butchering little boys and selling them to the Turk?</p>

<blockquote>

<p><span class="small-c">AGDA</span>. Is that true?</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="small-c">ERIC</span>. There is some truth in it, I think.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">JORGHEN</span>. Let the maiden go before she begins to cry. I can't bear tears.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ERIC</span>. I suppose you have never cried, Jorghen?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">JORGHEN</span>. Twice: when I was born, and once after that&mdash;out of rage.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ERIC</span>. You are a beast, Jorghen.</p>

<blockquote>

<p><span class="small-c">AGDA</span> <i>goes back into the tavern</i>.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="small-c">JORGHEN</span>. However&mdash;you wish to figure out what is to happen, and to
form a decision on the basis of your false calculations. Have you not
noticed how all our plans are foiled? That's the game of the gods.
Sometimes we act wisely, and everything goes to the devil, and then
we act like fools, and everything turns out right. It's nothing but
humbug&mdash;all of it!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ERIC</span>. I think so, too, and yet there must be some sort of sense in it.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">JORGHEN</span>. Not as far as I can see. It's just like dicing.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ERIC</span>. Let the dice rattle, then!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">JORGHEN</span>. Let them rattle! That's the right word for it. Now it's a
question of head or tail, however&mdash;whether the King is to be the tail,
and the man from Småland the head.... Look, who comes here!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ERIC</span>. Did you see?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">JORGHEN</span>. Not a thing.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ERIC</span>. Didn't you hear, either? Didn't you notice her voice?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">JORGHEN</span>. A voice like that of any jade&mdash;rather pert.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ERIC</span>. Stop your tongue, Jorghen! I love her!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">JORGHEN</span>. She is not the first.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ERIC</span>. Yes, the first, and the only one!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">JORGHEN</span>. Well, seduce her if you must.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ERIC</span>. [<i>Drawing his sword</i>] Take care, or by God!...</p>

<p><span class="small-c">JORGHEN</span>. Have we now got to the poking point again?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ERIC</span>. I don't know what has happened, but this moment has made me
despise you. The same city can't hold you and me. Your eyes defile me,
and your whole being stinks. I shall leave you, and I don't want to
see you face to face again.&mdash;It is as if an angel had come to take me
away from the habitations of the damned. I despise my whole past, as I
despise you and myself.</p>

<p>[<i>He goes out in the same direction as</i> <span class="small-c">KARIN</span> <i>went before</i>.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="small-c">JORGHEN</span>. Seems to be serious this time. But I guess you'll come back.
[<i>He raps on the table</i>.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">AGDA</span> <i>appears</i>.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="small-c">JORGHEN</span>. Do you know Karin, the flower girl?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">AGDA</span>. Yes, I do.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">JORGHEN</span>. What kind of a piece is she?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">AGDA</span>. A nice and decent girl, of whom I have never heard anything bad.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">JORGHEN</span>. Can you see anything beautiful about her?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">AGDA</span>. No, but she is rather pretty, and there is like a halo of
sweetness about her.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">JORGHEN</span>. Oh, it was that he saw, then!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">AGDA</span>. Tell me, secretary, are you really as hard as people say?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">JORGHEN</span>. I am not hard to anybody, child, but the world has been hard
to me ever since I was born.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">AGDA</span>. Why don't you always speak like that?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">JORGHEN</span> However, the Prince is enamoured, bewitched.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">AGDA</span>. Poor fellow!&mdash;Tell me, secretary, is the Prince quite right?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">JORGHEN</span>. You and your questions are very amusing. Let me ask you one
now. Hm! Do you think a woman could possibly&mdash;hm!&mdash;love me?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">AGDA</span>. No, I don't. [<span class="small-c">JORGHEN</span> <i>looks offended</i>] Not unless you try to be
good.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">JORGHEN</span>. How the devil is that to be done?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">AGDA</span>. Shame! Shame!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">JORGHEN</span>. If you never see anything good, how can you believe in it?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">AGDA</span>. Tell me, secretary, did the Prince mean what he said about the
Hanseatic people and what they are doing in that house?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">JORGHEN</span>. No, child! That was only a cruel jest. But no Swedish
authority can interfere with what they are doing in there. That much
you should know, if you are worrying about your Jacob.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">AGDA</span>. Will you do me a favour? It won't cost you anything.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">JORGHEN</span>. With the greatest pleasure, my dear girl.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">AGDA</span>. Find Jacob for me! He had promised to meet me, and he never came.
We have been ringing the bell at the door, but no one answers.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">JORGHEN</span>. I don't want to hurt you, Agda, but unfortunately I have
reason to believe that all the Luebeck people have gone away on account
of the new rebellion.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">AGDA</span>. And he won't come back, you think?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">JORGHEN</span>. I don't like to prophesy, because it generally turns out the
other way, but I don't think he will be back soon.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">AGDA</span>. [<i>Sinking to the ground</i>] Lord Jesus!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">JORGHEN</span>. [<i>Rises and helps her to her feet</i>] What is it, girl?&mdash;Tell
me! [<i>in a lower voice</i>] A child?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">AGDA</span>. He had given me his promise.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">JORGHEN</span>. [<i>Genuinely moved</i>] Poor woman!</p>

<blockquote>

<p><span class="small-c">AGDA</span> <i>watches him closely</i>.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="small-c">JORGHEN</span>. Misery, always misery, wherever love gets in its work!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">AGDA</span>. And you don't despise me?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">JORGHEN</span>. I pity you, as I pity all of us.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">AGDA</span>. Can you see now that good exists?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">JORGHEN</span>. Where?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">AGDA</span>. Within yourself.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">JORGHEN</span>. Pooh!&mdash;Is there anything else I can do for you?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">AGDA</span>. Yes, secretary, if you would write to Luebeck and ask Jacob....</p>

<p><span class="small-c">JORGHEN</span>. I have not much use for love-affairs, but I'll write,
nevertheless, provided we find that he really has gone away.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">AGDA</span>. [<i>Tries to kiss his hand, which he pulls away</i>] Thank you!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">JORGHEN</span>. What are you doing, woman? I am no bishop!&mdash;But hush! Here
comes illustrious company. So I think I'll sneak off!</p>

<p><i>The stage has grown darker in the meantime</i>.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="small-c">AGDA</span>. Please, secretary, don't forget me now!</p>

Herman Israel this very evening&mdash;I must!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">JOHAN</span>. You are worried, father?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">KING</span>. I am certainly not at ease. [<i>Pause</i>.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">FIRST BEGGAR</span>. We are perishing, my noble lord!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">KING</span>. I am perishing, too!&mdash;Why are you begging, anyhow?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">SECOND BEGGAR</span>. I'll tell you. Because the King has seized the tithes
that went to the poor before. And when he did so, he said: "You can
beg!"</p>

<p><span class="small-c">KING</span>. And what is he doing with the tithes of the poor?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">FIRST BEGGAR</span>. Paying Prince Eric's le-lecheries!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">KING</span>. No, paying the country's debt, you knaves! [<i>To</i> <span class="small-c">JOHAN</span>] Give them
money, so we get rid of them.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">JOHAN</span>. [<i>Distributing coins</i>] You'll have to share it between you, and

that no matter how high up you get, new and then you have to climb down

<p>[<i>He takes off his hat and wipes his forehead</i>.</p></blockquote>

<p>WIDOW. Can that be Herman Israel who is sitting there? My eyes have

<p><span class="small-c">BARBRO</span>. It must be him.</p>

<blockquote>

<p><i>The two women approach the</i> <span class="small-c">KING</span>.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="small-c">BARBRO</span>. [To <i>the</i> <span class="small-c">KING</span>] Are you the Councillor?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">KING</span>. What do you want of him?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">BARBRO</span>. Mr. Syndic, we are the bereaved dependents of Mons Nilsson, and
we have come to pray that you put in a good word for us with the King.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">KING</span>. Why do you think the Councillor's word will be of any help?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">BARBRO</span>. We have been told that he is the King's only friend, and we
thought he might help us to get back the property of which we have been
unjustly deprived.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">KING</span>. Unjustly, you say? As a traitor, Mons Nilsson was judged forfeit
of life <i>and</i> goods&mdash;which was only just!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">BARBRO</span>. But the dower of the innocent widow should not have been taken
with the rest.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">KING</span>. What is your name?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">BARBRO</span>. I was baptised with the name of Barbro, and the King himself
acted as my godfather when he was in Dalecarlia at that time.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">KING</span>. [<i>Rises, but sits down again immediately</i>] Barbro?&mdash;Have you ever
seen the King?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">BARBRO</span>. Not since I was too small to know him. But the last time he
visited Copperberg, my father was expecting him, and we children were
to greet him with a song.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">KING</span>. What song was that?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">BARBRO</span>. I cannot sing since my father came to his death so miserably,
but it was a song about King Gustavus and the Dalecarlians, and this is
the way it ended:</p>

<p style="margin-left: 25%;">
"You have by my side been fighting<br />
Like sturdy Swedish men.<br />

I'll do you good in stead."<br />
</p>

<p><span class="small-c">KING</span>. Say something really bad about the King!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">BARBRO</span>. No, father told us we must never do that, no matter what we
might hear other people say.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">KING</span>. Did your father tell you that?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">BARBRO</span>. Yes, he did.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">KING</span>. Go in peace now. I shall speak to the King, and you shall have
your rights, for he wants to do right, and he tries to do it.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">BARBRO</span>. [<i>Kneels and takes hold of the</i> <span class="small-c">KING'S</span> <i>hand, which she

would be no cause for worry.</p>

know that he won't refuse his goddaughter anything. Go in peace now!</p>

<p><i>The two women leave</i>.</p></blockquote>

like a defendant&mdash;I, the highest judge of the land!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">JOHAN</span>. May I say a word?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">KING</span>. No, because I can tell myself what you want to say. I can tell
that the hand of the Lord has been laid heavily upon me, although I
cannot tell why. If the Lord speaks through conscience and prayer, then
it is he who has made me act as I have acted. Why my obedience should
be punished, I cannot grasp. But I submit to a higher wisdom that lies
beyond my reason.&mdash;That girl was my goddaughter, and her father was my
friend, and I had to take his head.... Oh, cruel life, that has to be

<p><span class="small-c">MARCUS</span>. I cannot tell. But he asked me to bring you his greeting and to
give you this ring.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">AGDA</span>. As a keepsake only, or as a plight of his troth?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">MARCUS</span>. Read what it says.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">AGDA</span>. [<i>Studying the ring</i>] Yes, I can spell a little "For ever," it
says. What does it mean?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">MARCUS</span>. I fear it means&mdash;farewell for ever.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">MARCUS</span> <i>does not answer</i>.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="small-c">AGDA</span>. Who killed him?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">MARCUS</span>. The law and his own crime. He rebelled against his father and
his country.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">AGDA</span>. To save mine!&mdash;Oh, what is to become of me?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">MARCUS</span>. [<i>Shrugging his shoulders</i>] That's the way of the world.
Nothing but deceit and uncertainty.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CHRISTINE</span>. Do I disturb you?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">OLAVUS</span>. [<i>Quietly and coldly</i>] Naturally, as I am writing.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CHRISTINE</span>. Are you sure that you are writing?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">OLAVUS</span>. Absolutely sure.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CHRISTINE</span>. But I have not seen your pen move for a long while.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">OLAVUS</span>. That was because I was thinking.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CHRISTINE</span>. Once....</p>

<p><span class="small-c">OLAVUS</span>. Yes, once upon a time!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CHRISTINE</span>. Can Reginald come in and say good-bye?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">OLAVUS</span>. Are we that far already?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CHRISTINE</span>. The carriage is waiting and all his things have been packed.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">OLAVUS</span>. Let him come, then.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CHRISTINE</span>. Are you certain that he is going to Wittenberg to study?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">OLAVUS</span>. I have seen too much uncertainty, as you know, to be certain of
anything. If you have reason to doubt the feasibility of his plans, you
had better say so.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CHRISTINE</span>. If I had any doubts, I would not disturb you with them.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">OLAVUS</span>. Always equally amiable! Will you please ask Reginald to come
here?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CHRISTINE</span>. I'll do whatever you command.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">OLAVUS</span>. And as I never command, but merely ask....</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CHRISTINE</span>. If you would command your precious son now and then, he
might be a little more polite and obedient to his mother.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">OLAVUS</span>. Reginald is hard, I admit, but you do wrong in trying to
educate him to suit your own high pleasure.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CHRISTINE</span>. Do you side with the children against their parents?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">OLAVUS</span>. If I am not mistaken, I have always done so when the natural
rights of the children were concerned.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CHRISTINE</span>. Have the children any natural rights to anything?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">OLAVUS</span>. Of course, they have! You haven't forgotten how we....</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CHRISTINE</span>. Yes, I have forgotten every bit of that old tommy-rot! I
have forgotten how you swore to love me. I have forgotten the noise
made about the pope's beard, and the stealing of the church silver,
and the humbug with the bells, and the <i>pure</i> faith, and roast ducks
and cackling swans, and martyrs with a taste for fighting, and the
following of Christ with wine and women, and the scratching of eyes and
tearing of hair, until we now have twenty-five brand new faiths in
place of a holy Catholic Church.... I have forgotten every bit of it!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">OLAVUS</span>. Perhaps that was the best thing you could do. And will you
please ask Reginald to come here now?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CHRISTINE</span>. Certainly, I'll ask him to come here, and it will be a great
pleasure to do so. [<i>She goes out to the left</i>.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">OLAVUS</span>. [<i>Alone, speaking to himself</i>] Happy she, who has been able to
forget! I remember everything!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CHRISTINE</span> <i>returns with</i> <span class="small-c">REGINALD</span>.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">REGINALD</span>. I want mother to go out, because I can't talk when she is
here.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">OLAVUS</span>. There won't be so very much to talk about.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CHRISTINE</span>. I won't say a word; only listen&mdash;and look at you. [<i>She
seats herself</i>.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">REGINALD</span>. No, you mustn't look at us.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">OLAVUS</span>. Be quiet, boy, and be civil to your mother! When you go
travelling, there is no telling whether you ever come back.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">REGINALD</span>. So much the better!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">OLAVUS</span>. [<i>Painfully impressed</i>] What's that?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">REGINALD</span>. I am tired of everything, and I just wish I were dead!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">OLAVUS</span>. Yes, that's the way youth talks nowadays!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">REGINALD</span>. And why? Because we don't know what to believe!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">OLAVUS</span>. Oh, you don't? And how about the articles of confession? Don't
you believe in them?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">REGINALD</span>. Believe, you say? Don't you know that belief comes as a grace
of God?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">OLAVUS</span>. Are you a Calvinist?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">REGINALD</span>. I don't know what I am. When I talk with Prince Johan, he
says I am a papist, and when I meet Prince Eric, he tells me I am a
follower of Zwingli.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">OLAVUS</span>. And now you wish to go to Wittenberg to learn the true faith
from Doctor Martin Luther?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">REGINALD</span>. I know his teachings and don't believe in them,</p>

<p><span class="small-c">OLAVUS</span>. Is that so?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">REGINALD</span>. To him belief is everything, and deeds nothing. I have
believed, but it didn't make my deeds any better at all, and so I felt
like a perfect hypocrite in the end.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">OLAVUS</span>. Is Prince Johan a Catholic?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">REGINALD</span>. So he must be, as he sticks to deeds, which ought to be the
main thing.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">OLAVUS</span>. And Prince Eric belongs to the Reformed Church, you say?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">REGINALD</span>. Yes, in so far as he believes in the dispensation of grace.
And Jorghen Persson must be a Satanist, I think. And young Sture is
absolutely an Anabaptist....</p>

<p><span class="small-c">OLAVUS</span>. Well, this is news to me! I thought the days of schism were
past....</p>

<p><span class="small-c">REGINALD</span>. Schism, yes&mdash;that's the word Prince Johan is using always. We
had a Catholic Church, and then....</p>

<p><span class="small-c">OLAVUS</span>. Oh, shut your mouth and go to Wittenberg!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">REGINALD</span>. As it is your wish, father&mdash;but I won't study any more
theology.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">OLAVUS</span>. Why not?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">REGINALD</span>. I think it is device of the devil to make people hate each
other.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CHRISTINE</span>. Good for you, Reginald!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">OLAVUS</span>. And it had to come to this in my own house! <i>Pulchre, bene,
rede!</i>&mdash;Who, Reginald, do you think has caused this dissension under
which you young people are suffering now?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">REGINALD</span>. That's easily answered.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">OLAVUS</span>. Of course! We old ones, you mean? But we, too, were children of
our time, and were stripped of our faith by our prophets. Who is, then,
to blame?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">REGINALD</span>. No one.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">OLAVUS</span>. And what do you mean to do with your future?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">REGINALD</span>. My future? It appears to me like a grey mist without a ray
of sunlight. And should a ray ever break through, it will at once be
proved a will-o'-the-wisp leading us astray.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">OLAVUS</span>. That's just how I felt once! At your age I could see my whole
future as in vision. I foresaw the bitter cup and the pillory. And yet
I had to go on. I had to enter the mist, and I myself had to carry the
will-o'-the-wisp that <i>must</i> lead the wanderers astray. I foretold this
very moment, even, when my son would stand before me saying: "Thus I
am, because thus you have made me!" You noticed, perhaps, that I was
not surprised&mdash;and this is the reason.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">REGINALD</span>. What am I to do? Advise me!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">OLAVUS</span>. You, no more than I, will follow the advices given you.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">REGINALD</span>. Inform me, then! Tell me: what is life?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">OLAVUS</span>. That's more than I know. But I think it must be a punishment
or an ordeal. At your years I thought I knew everything and understood
everything. Now I know nothing and understand nothing. For that reason
I rest satisfied with doing my duty and bearing what comes my way.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">REGINALD</span>. But I want to know!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">OLAVUS</span>. You want to know what is not allowed to be known. Try to know
and you will perish!&mdash;However, do you want to go or stay?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">REGINALD</span>. I am going to Wittenberg to pull Luther to pieces!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">OLAVUS</span>. [<i>Wholly without irony</i>] That's the way to speak! O thou
splendid youth with thy Alexandrian regret that there are no more
things to pull to pieces!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">REGINALD</span>. Are you not a Lutheran?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">OLAVUS</span>. I am a Protestant.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CHRISTINE</span>. If you have finished now, I shall ask permission to tell in
a single word what Luther is&mdash;just one word!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">OLAVUS</span>. Oh, do, before you burst!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CHRISTINE</span>. Luther is dead!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">OLAVUS</span>. Dead?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CHRISTINE</span>. That's what my brother-in-law writes me in this letter from
Magdeburg.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">OLAVUS</span>. [<i>Rising</i>] Dead! [<i>To</i> <span class="small-c">REGINALD</span>] My poor Alexander, what will
you pull to pieces now?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">REGINALD</span>. First the universe, and then myself.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">OLAVUS</span>. [<i>Pushing him toward the door at the left</i>] Go ahead, then, but
begin with yourself. The universe will always remain.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CHRISTINE</span>. [<i>As she rises and is about to go out with</i> <span class="small-c">REGINALD</span>] Will
there be peace on earth now?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">OLAVUS</span>. That will never be!&mdash;Let me have that letter.</p>

<blockquote>

<p><span class="small-c">CHRISTINE</span> <i>and</i> <span class="small-c">REGINALD</span> <i>go out to the left</i>.</p>

<p><i>While</i> <span class="small-c">OLAVUS</span> <i>is reading the letter, a hard knock is heard at
the right-hand door</i>.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="small-c">OLAVUS</span>. Come!</p>

<blockquote>

<p><i>The knock is repeated</i>. <span class="small-c">OLAVUS</span> <i>goes to the door and opens it.
The</i> <span class="small-c">KING</span> <i>enters, wearing his big hat and his cloak, which he
throws of</i>.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="small-c">OLAVUS</span>. The King!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">KING</span>. [<i>Very excited</i>] Yes, but for how long? Do you know who Dacke
is?&mdash;A farm labourer who has killed a bailiff; a common thief and
incendiary, who is now writing to me with a demand of answer. I am
to take pen in hand and open correspondence with a scamp like him!
Do you know that he has crossed the Kolmord Forests and stands with
one foot in West Gothia and the other in East Gothia?&mdash;Who is back
of him? The Emperor, the Elector Frederick of the Palatinate, Magnus
Haraldsson, the runaway Bishop of Skara, the Duke of Mecklenburg. The
Emperor wishes to put the children of Christian the Tyrant back on the
throne.<a name="FNanchor_3_22" id="FNanchor_3_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_22" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> But what troubles me more than anything else is to find the
Luebeckians and Herman Israel on the same side&mdash;my old friend Herman! I
ask you how it can be possible. And who has done this to me? Who?&mdash;Have
you not a word to say?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">OLAVUS</span>. What can I say, and what&mdash;<i>may</i> I say?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">KING</span>. Don't be hard on me, Olof, and don't be vengeful, I am nothing
but an unfortunate human creature who has had to drink humiliation like
water, and I come to you as my spiritual guide. I am in despair because
I fear that the Lord has deserted me for ever.&mdash;What an infernal notion
of mine that was to take the head of the Dalecarlians just now, when I
am in such need of them! Do you think that deed was displeasing to the
Lord? But if I have sinned like David, you must be my Nathan.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">OLAVUS</span>. I have lost the power of prophecy, and I am not the right man
to inflict punishment.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">KING</span>. Console me, then, Olof.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">OLAVUS</span>. I cannot, because only those who repent can accept consolation.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">KING</span>. You mean that I have transgressed&mdash;that I have gone too far?
Speak up! But do it like a servant of the Lord, and not like a
conceited schoolmaster.... Have I gone too far?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">OLAVUS</span>. That is not the way to put the question. The proper way is to
ask whether the others have any right on their side.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">KING</span>. Go ahead and ask!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">OLAVUS</span>. Dacke is the mouthpiece of warranted dissatisfaction. Being
the brother-in-law of Christian II, the Emperor is the guardian of his
children, and they have inherited a claim to the Swedish throne, as
the constitution cannot be cancelled by a rebellion.<a name="FNanchor_4_23" id="FNanchor_4_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_23" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> Bishop Magnus
Haraldsson is the spokesman of all the illegally exiled bishops.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">KING</span>. Illegally, you say?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">OLAVUS</span>. [<i>Raising his voice</i>] Yes, because the law of Sweden does not
drive any man away on account of his faith.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">KING</span>. Take care!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">OLAVUS</span>. Too late now!&mdash;The dissatisfaction of the peasants is
warranted, because the Riksdag at Vesterås authorised the King to seize
only the property of bishops and convents. When he took what belonged
to parish churches and private persons, he became guilty of a crime.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">KING</span>. You are a daring man!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">OLAVUS</span>. Nothing compared with what I used to be!&mdash;As far as Herman
Israel is concerned, he called recently on the King to offer a treaty
of friendship, and it was stupid of the King to reject it.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">KING</span>. Stop!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">OLAVUS</span>. Not yet!&mdash;The gold and silver of the churches was meant to pay
the debt to Luebeck, and much of it was used for that purpose, but a
considerable part found its way to Eskil's Chamber under the Royal
Palace, and has since been wasted on Prince Eric's silly courtships
among other things....</p>

<p><span class="small-c">KING</span>. The devil you say!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">OLAVUS</span>. Well, Queen Elizabeth is merely making fun of him.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">KING</span>. Do you know that?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">OLAVUS</span>. I do.&mdash;The bells were also to be used in payment of the debt to
Luebeck, but a part of them went to the foundry and were turned into
cannon, which was not right.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">KING</span>. Is that so?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">OLAVUS</span>. Add also that the Convent of Vreta was left unmolested
in violation of the ordinance concerning the closing of all such
places&mdash;and for no other reason than that the King's mother-in-law
happened to be a Catholic. This is a cowardly and mischievous omission
that has caused much bad blood.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">KING</span>. The convent is to be closed.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">OLAVUS</span>. It should be closed <i>now</i>, and it is not!&mdash;If I were to sum
up what is reprehensible in my great King, I should call it a lack of
piety.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">KING</span>. That's the worst yet! What do you mean?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">OLAVUS</span>. Piety is the respect shown by the stronger even if he be a man
of destiny&mdash;for the feelings of the weaker, when these spring from a
childlike, and for that reason religious, mind.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">KING</span>. Oh, is that what it is?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">OLAVUS</span>. Now I have said my say.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">KING</span>. Yes, so you have&mdash;time and again.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">OLAVUS</span>. And if my King had been willing to listen now and then, he
would have learned a great deal more. But it is a common fault of
princes that they won't listen to anybody but themselves.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">KING</span>. Well, I never heard the like of it! I am astounded&mdash;most of all
because I haven't killed you on the spot!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">OLAVUS</span>. Why don't you?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">KING</span>. [<i>Rises and goes toward</i> <span class="small-c">OLAVUS</span>, <i>who remains standing unabashed,
looking firmly at the approaching</i> <span class="small-c">KING</span>; <i>the latter withdraws backward
and sits down again; for a few moments the two men stare at each other
in silence; then the</i> <span class="small-c">KING</span> <i>says]</i> Who are you?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">OLAVUS</span>. A humble instrument of the Lord, shaped to serve what is really
great&mdash;that marvellous man of God, to whom it was granted to unite all
Swedish men and lands.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">KING</span>. That was granted Engelbrecht, too, and his reward was the axe
that split his head.<a name="FNanchor_5_24" id="FNanchor_5_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_24" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> Is that to be my reward, too?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">OLAVUS</span>. I don't think so, your Highness, but it depends on yourself.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">KING</span>. What am I to do?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">OLAVUS</span>. What you advised me to do when I was carried away by the zeal
of my youth.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">KING</span>. And you think it necessary to return that advice to me now?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">OLAVUS</span>. Why not? I have learned from life, and you have forgotten.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">KING</span>. What am I to do?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">OLAVUS</span>. Answer Dacke's letter.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">KING</span>. Never! Am I to bow down to a vagabond?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">OLAVUS</span>. The Lord sometimes uses mere vagabonds for our humiliation.
Picture it to yourself as an ordeal by fire.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">KING</span>. [<i>Rising and walking the floor</i>] There is truth in what you say.
I can feel it, but it does not fetch bottom in my mind. Say one word
more.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">OLAVUS</span>. Dacke will be right as long as you are in the wrong, and God
will be with him until you take your place on the side of right.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">KING</span>. I can't bend!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">OLAVUS</span>. Then you'll be broken by someone else.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">KING</span>. [<i>Walking back and forth</i>] Are you thinking of the Dalecarlians?
Have you heard of a rising among them on account of the executions?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">OLAVUS</span>. Such a thing has been rumoured.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">KING</span>. I am lost.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">OLAVUS</span>. Write to Dacke!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">KING</span>. [<i>Without conviction</i>] I won't.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">OLAVUS</span>. The Emperor does.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">KING</span>. That's true! If the Emperor can write to him, why shouldn't
I?&mdash;But it is perfectly senseless. Who is this mysterious man who never
appears?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">OLAVUS</span>. Perhaps another marvellous man of God&mdash;in his own way.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">KING</span>. I must see him face to face. I'll write and offer him
safe-conduct, so that I can talk with him. That's what I'll do.&mdash;Bring
me pen and paper! Or you write, and I'll dictate.</p>

<blockquote>

<p><span class="small-c">OLAVUS</span> <i>seats himself at the table</i>.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="small-c">KING</span>. How do we begin? What am I to call him?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">OLAVUS</span>. Let us merely put down "To Nils Dacke."</p>

<p><span class="small-c">KING</span>. Oh, his name is Nils? After St. Nicolaus, who comes with rods for
children on the sixth of December?<a name="FNanchor_6_25" id="FNanchor_6_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_25" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> [<i>Pause</i>] Write now.... No, I'll
go home and do the writing myself.... Have you heard that Luther is
dead?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">OLAVUS</span>. I have, your Highness.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">KING</span>. He was a splendid man! May he rest in peace!&mdash;Yes, such as he
was, he was a fine man, but we got rather too much of him.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">OLAVUS</span>. Too many dogmas and not enough of religion.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">KING</span>. He was an obstinate fellow and went too far. What he needed was
a taskmaster like you to call him to terms now and then.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">OLAVUS</span>. I hope the time of schism and dissension will come to an end
now.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">KING</span>. A time of dissension you may well call it!&mdash;Good-bye, Olof. [<i>As</i>
<span class="small-c">OLAVUS</span> <i>makes a mien of saying something</i>] Yes, yes, I <i>will</i> write!</p>

<blockquote>

<p><i>The terrace in front of the Royal Palace, with trimmed hedges,
statuary, and a fountain. Chairs, benches, and tables are
placed about. The near background shows a balustrade with
Tuscan columns, on which are placed flowers in faïence pots.
Beyond the balustrade appear tree tops, and over these tower
the tops of masts, from which blue and yellow flags are flying.
In the far background, a number of church spires</i>.</p>

<p><i>The</i> <span class="small-c">MOTHER-IN-LAW</span> <i>of the</i> <span class="small-c">KING</span> <i>is on the terrace in her
Cistercian dress</i>.</p></blockquote>


<p><span class="small-c">QUEEN</span>. [<i>Enters</i>] For the last time I beg you, mother, don't wear that
dress!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">MOTHER-IN-LAW</span>. It is my festive garb, and I am as proud of it as you of
your ermine robe.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">QUEEN</span>. What is the use of being proud? The day of disaster is upon us
all, and we must hold together.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">MOTHER-IN-LAW</span>. Let us do so then, and have peace.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">QUEEN</span>. Yes, so you say, but you won't even change dress for the sake of
the country's peace.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">MOTHER-IN-LAW</span>. I don't change faith as you change clothes, and there is
a solemn vow to God connected with this dress. The people are making
threats against my life. Let them take it! I have my grave-clothes on.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">QUEEN</span>. Don't you know that we may have to flee this very day, if the
news should prove as bad as yesterday?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">MOTHER-IN-LAW</span>. I will not flee.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">QUEEN</span>. Everything has already been packed by order of the King, and our
sloop lies at the foot of the southern hills, ready to hoist sail.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">MOTHER-IN-LAW</span>. I have nothing to pack, because I own nothing. "Be thou
faithful unto death, and I will give thee a crown of life." That's what
I used to learn. But you have sold your birthright for a crown which
soon will no longer be yours.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">QUEEN</span>. Go on and punish me; it feels like a relief.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>PRINCE <span class="small-c">ERIC</span> <i>appears on the terrace; his dress and appearance
are orderly, and his mien subdued</i>.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="small-c">MOTHER-IN-LAW</span>. Can you tell me what has come over Eric these last days?
He looks quite submissive, and something new has come into his face
that used to be so hard.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">QUEEN</span>. I don't know, but they say that he has changed his ways and
cannot bear the company of Jorghen. I have heard whispers about a
serious affection....</p>

<p><span class="small-c">MOTHER-IN-LAW</span>. No!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">QUEEN</span>. [<i>To</i> <span class="small-c">ERIC</span>] What news do you bring?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ERIC</span>. [<i>Gently and respectfully</i>] No news at all, mother.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">QUEEN</span>. [<i>To her mother</i>] He called me mother! [<i>To</i> <span class="small-c">ERIC</span>] How fare you,
Eric? Is life heavy?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ERIC</span>. Heavier than it was the day before yesterday.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">QUEEN</span>. What happened yesterday?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ERIC</span>. What happens to a human being only once in a lifetime.&mdash;Are you
much wiser now?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">QUEEN</span>. [<i>To her mother</i>] How childlike he has grown! [<i>To</i> Eric] Have
you heard anything of your friend Jacob?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ERIC</span>. Yes, he was my real friend, and so they took his head.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">QUEEN</span>. Now you are unjust. There has been no attempt to take the head
of Jorghen....</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ERIC</span>. He is no longer my friend. [<i>Peevishly</i>] But now I don't want to
be questioned any longer, least of all about my secrets&mdash;that is, about
the secrets of my heart.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">QUEEN</span>. [<i>To her mother</i>] He is quite charming in his childishness.
Apparently he would love to talk of his secret.</p>

<blockquote>

<p><span class="small-c">PRINCE JOHAN</span> <i>enters</i>.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="small-c">ERIC</span>. [<i>Going to meet him</i>] Soon we may have nothing left to fight
over, brother Johan, and so&mdash;it seems to me we may as well be friends.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">JOHAN</span>. With a right good heart, brother! Nothing could give me greater
pleasure.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ERIC</span>. Give me your hand! [<i>They shake hands</i>] I don't want to be the
enemy of any human being after this.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>[<i>He goes out, deeply moved</i>.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="small-c">MOTHER-IN-LAW</span>. [<i>To</i> Johan] What's the matter with Eric?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">JOHAN</span>. He has found a sweetheart, they say.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">QUEEN</span>. What did I say?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">MOTHER-IN-LAW</span>. Are you coming with me to the mass in the chapel, Johan?
[<i>When</i> <span class="small-c">JOHAN</span> <i>hesitates and does not answer, she says sharply</i>] Johan!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">QUEEN</span>. Mother!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">MOTHER-IN-LAW</span>. Is he free to follow his conscience, or is he not?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">QUEEN</span>. If you will leave his conscience alone, he will be free.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">MOTHER-IN-LAW</span>. Well, I am going, and you know where, Johan. [<i>She goes
out</i>.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">QUEEN</span>. Johan!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">JOHAN</span>. What do you wish?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">QUEEN</span>. That you do not desert your childhood faith.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">JOHAN</span>. My childhood faith, which I got from my nurse, and not from you,
was also the childhood faith of my father. Why did you not give me
yours?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">QUEEN</span>. Yes, punish me. You have a right to do so. Everything comes home
to us now. I was young then. Life was nothing but a game. The King
demanded my company at banquets and festivities, and so your cradle was
left unattended and unguarded. Those were the days when we were drunk
with victory and happiness. And now!&mdash;Go where you find it possible to
worship, Johan, and pray for your mother!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">JOHAN</span>. If it hurts my gracious mother, I won't go.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">QUEEN</span>. Pray for us all! [<i>In a lowered voice</i>] I do not know the new
prayers and must not use the old ones!&mdash;Hush now! The King is coming.</p>

<blockquote>

<p><span class="small-c">PRINCE JOHAN</span> <i>goes in the direction previously taken by the</i>
<span class="small-c">KING'S MOTHER-IN-LAW</span>.</p>

<p><i>The</i> <span class="small-c">KING</span> <i>enters, holding a letter in his hand. He is
accompanied by</i> <span class="small-c">MASTER OLAVUS PETRI</span>.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="small-c">KING</span>. [<i>To the</i> <span class="small-c">QUEEN</span>] Have everything ready for the start. We are lost!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">QUEEN</span>. The will of God be done!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">KING</span>. That's what seems to be happening. Go and look after your house,
child.</p>

<blockquote>

<p><i>The</i> <span class="small-c">QUEEN</span> <i>goes out</i>.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="small-c">KING</span>. [<i>To</i> <span class="small-c">OLAVUS</span>] This is the situation. Dacke answers that he
does not care to see "that rebel, and perjurer, and breaker of
safe-conducts, Ericsson." He rails me Ericsson, mind you. His people
have reached as far north as Södermanland&mdash;which means that they are
right at our gates! Furthermore, two thousand Dalecarlians are encamped
at the North Gate. Their intentions are not known, but can easily be
guessed. A fine prophet you are, Olof!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">OLAVUS</span>. We have not seen the end yet.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">KING</span>. Where do you get your confidence from?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">OLAVUS</span>. That's more than I can tell, but I know that everything will
end well.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">KING</span>. You say that you know? How do you know? I have ceased to believe
anything&mdash;except in the wrath of God, which has been turned against me.
I am now waiting for the axe. Good and well! I have done my service
and am now to be discharged. That's why I wish to leave before I am
kicked out.&mdash;Do you know what day it is to-day? Nobody has thought of
it, and I didn't remember until just now.... It is Midsummer Day: <i>my</i>
day, which no one celebrates. A generation ago I made my entry into
the capital on this day. That was the greatest moment of my life. I
thought the work of liberation was done, and I thanked God for it!&mdash;But
it had not been done, and I am not done with it yet.&mdash;The Dalecarlians
rose. I subdued them, and thought that I was done, which I was not.
Twice more they rose, and each time I gave thanks to God, thinking I
had done&mdash;which was not the case. The lords of West Gothia rose. I
squelched them, and was happy, thinking that I surely must have done
by that time&mdash;which I had not. And now, Olof?&mdash;We are never done until
done for&mdash;and that's where I am now!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">OLAVUS</span>. Oh, no, there is a whole lot left.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">KING</span>. Where do you get your fixed ideas from? Have you heard some bird
sing, or have you been dreaming?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">OLAVUS</span>. Neither.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">KING</span>. [<i>Listening</i>] Listen! That's the sound of birch-horns. Do they
mean to give me a crown of birch, like the one I gave to Peder the
Chancellor and Master Knut? Or is it the scaffold that.... that?...</p>

<p><span class="small-c">OLAVUS</span>. Oh, don't!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">KING</span>. What was it you called that thing&mdash;piety? Much it would have
availed me to have piety at Larv Heath or Tuna Plain!<a name="FNanchor_1_26" id="FNanchor_1_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_26" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>&mdash;No, I have
been right, right, right, so God help me, amen!</p>

<blockquote>

<p><span class="small-c">OLAVUS</span> <i>makes no answer</i>.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="small-c">KING</span>. [<i>Listening</i>] They have drums, too.&mdash;Oh, everything comes
home!&mdash;Do you think I can get out of this, Olof?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">OLAVUS</span>. I do! And let me give you a final piece of advice: don't leave!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">KING</span>. I don't see how it can be avoided. Do you think I'll let them
take my head?&mdash;Do you know, I can actually hear the tramp-tramp of
their feet as they come marching through the North Gate. And that's the
Dalecarlians&mdash;my own Dalecarlians! Oh, life is cruel! Can you hear it?
Tramp&mdash;tramp&mdash;tramp! Do you think I can get out of this?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">OLAVUS</span>. I do.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">KING</span>. When the sun rises to-morrow I shall know my fate. I wish I were
that far already!&mdash;Now I hear something else! [<i>The reading of a litany
in Latin is faintly heard from the outside</i>] What is that?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">OLAVUS</span>. [<i>Goes to the balustrade and looks over it</i>] The Queen's mother
is reading the Romish litany.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">KING</span>. But I hear a male voice, too.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">OLAVUS</span>. That's Prince Johan.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">KING</span>. Johan?&mdash;So I must drink that cup, too! I wonder if the cup is
full yet? Is everything that I have built to be torn down?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">OLAVUS</span>. Everything you have torn down must be built up again.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">KING</span>. Johan a papist, and Eric a Calvinist!&mdash;Do you remember the days
when we were crying in the words of Von Hutten: "The souls are waking
up, and it is a joy to live"? A joy to live, indeed&mdash;ha-ha! And the
souls woke up to find their feet on the pillows! Was it you who said
that the gods are playing with us?&mdash;Hush! I was mistaken a while ago!
It's the North Bridge they are crossing! Can't you hear their heavy
tread on the planking of the bridge? Let us fly! [<i>He puts a document
on a table</i>] Here I place my resignation.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">OLAVUS</span>. [<i>Seizing the document</i>] I'll take care of that. I'll keep
it&mdash;as a memento! And now we'll hoist a flag of truce.</p>

<blockquote>

<p><i>He pulls a white cloth from one of the tables and ties it to
the branch of a tree</i>.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="small-c">PRINCE ERIC</span>. [<i>Enters</i>] Father!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">KING</span>. Croak away, raven!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ERIC</span>. Our last hope is gone! The sloop has dragged its anchor and gone
ashore.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">KING</span>. [<i>In desperation</i>] And lightning has struck the nursery, and the
grasshoppers have eaten the crops, and the waters are rising, and....</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ERIC</span>. The Dalecarlians are negotiating with the palace guards, and they
are awfully drunk.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">KING</span>. [<i>Sitting down</i>] Come on, death!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ERIC</span>. [<i>Listening</i>] I can hear their wooden shoes on the garden stairs!
[<i>He goes to the balustrade</i>.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">KING</span>. [<i>Counting on his fingers</i>] Anders Persson, Mons Nilsson, Master
John.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ERIC</span>. [<i>Drawing his sword</i>] Now he is here!</p>

<blockquote>

<p><i>He can be seen following somebody on the other side of the
balustrade with his eyes</i>.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="small-c">KING</span>. [<i>As before</i>] Inghel Hansson, Master Stig, Nils of Söderby. God
is just!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ENGELBRECHT</span>. [<i>Enters; he is in the happy stage of intoxication, but
in full control of his movements for all that; he looks about with a
broad grin on his face, a little embarrassed, and yet pleased; then he
says to</i> <span class="small-c">ERIC</span>] Are you the King?</p>

<blockquote>

<p><i>He puts his hat on the ground and takes off his wooden shoes</i>.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="small-c">KING</span>. [<i>Rising and pushing</i> <span class="small-c">ERIC</span> <i>aside</i>] No, I am the King!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ENGELBRECHT</span>. Yes, so I see now!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">KING</span>. Who are you?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ENGELBRECHT</span>. [<i>Faltering</i>] Don't you know me?...</p>

<p><span class="small-c">KING</span>. I don't.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ENGELBRECHT</span>. [<i>Pulls a dagger with silver handle out of his long
stocking and shows it to the</i> <span class="small-c">KING</span>, <i>grinning more broadly than ever</i>]
Well, don't you know this one?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">KING</span>. I don't understand at all. What is your name?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ENGELBRECHT</span>. Well&mdash;it happens to be Engelbrecht!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">KING</span>. Eng-el-brecht?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ENGELBRECHT</span>. It sounds mighty big, but I am not of <i>that</i> family.&mdash;You
see, it was like this&mdash;once upon a time the King&mdash;who was no king at
all then&mdash;oh, mercy, but I am drunk!... Well, it was me who followed
you on skis to the border of Norway, and that time you gave me this
here dagger and said: "If you ever need me, come on!" Now I've come,
and here I am! And I wish only that I was not so frightfully drunk!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">KING</span>. And what do you want?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ENGELBRECHT</span>. What I want?&mdash;I want to fight that man Dacke, of course,
and that's what the rest of them want, too.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">KING</span>. You want to <i>fight</i> Dacke?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ENGELBRECHT</span>. Why do you think we have come, anyhow?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">KING</span>. [<i>Raising his arms toward heaven</i>] Eternal God, now you have
punished me!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ENGELBRECHT</span>. Is it all right? You see, the rest are down there and
they'd like to do something to celebrate the day.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">KING</span>. <i>Is it all right?</i>&mdash;Ask me for a favour!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ENGELBRECHT</span>. [<i>After thinking hard</i>] I'd like to shake hands!</p>

<blockquote>

<p><i>The</i> <span class="small-c">KING</span> <i>holds out his hand</i>.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="small-c">ENGELBRECHT</span>. [<i>Looking at the</i> King's <i>hand</i>] My, what a fist! Hard as
nails, but clean! Yes, and a devil of a fellow you are, all in all!&mdash;I
must say I was rather scared when I came here!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">KING</span>. Are all the rest of them as drunk as you are?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ENGELBRECHT</span>. About the same! But they can toot the horns for all that.
[<i>He goes to the balustrade, waves his hand and utters the yell used by
the Dalecarlians in calling their cows</i>] Poo-ala! Poo-ala! Poo Oy-ala!
Oy-ala! Oy!</p>

<p>NOTE TO THE MUSIC</p>

<p>The song of the long-tailed duck is given by Strindberg in the first
part of his "The Swedish People in War and Peace."</p>

<p>Melody No. 20 does not appear in the Swedish edition of the play. It
is given by Emil Schering in an appendix to his German version of
it&mdash;apparently from a manuscript placed at his disposal by Strindberg
himself.</p>

<p>Melodies Nos. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 12, 13, 14, 16, and 17
have been taken by Strindberg&mdash;without any changes&mdash;from Richard
Dybeck's "Svenska Vallvisor och Hornlåtar" ("Swedish Herd-Songs and
Horn-Melodies"), Stockholm, 1846. </p>
